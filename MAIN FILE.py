'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 25Â November 2021, its decision in case No. 407,Â in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬50,000Â on A.O.R.N. Antonio Cardarelli, a hospital within the national system for specialised hospitals, for its violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 6, and 9 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following its processing of personal data in the absence of a suitable legal basis.Â 
Background to the case
In particular, the GaranteÂ stated that the 'Transparent Administration' section ofÂ the hospital'sÂ institutional website had various downloadable documents containing personal data, including, among other things, contact details, tax codes, addresses, and sensitive personal data on health. In this regard, the Garante specified that the aforementioned personal dataÂ was usedÂ inÂ merit ranking in relation to the competition for recruitment of new staff to be employed in light of the Coronavirus and had been disseminated by the hospital under the mistaken belief of pursuing transparency in their actions. In doing so, the Guarante noted thatÂ the hospital did not take into account the current regulatory framework and the indications provided by the Garante to all public entities.
Findings of the Garante
Notably, the Garante found that the hospital, in disseminatingÂ personal data on its websiteÂ in the form of downloadable documents, had processed personal data unlawfully in the absence of a valid legal basis, thus violatingÂ the general principles of processing personal data under Articles 5 and 6 of the GDPR and inÂ contravention ofÂ the provisions relating to theÂ processing of sensitive personal data in Article 9 of the GDPR.
Outcomes

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 27 January 2022, its decision in Case No. 23, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬40,000 on T.S.M. s.r.l., for violations of Articles 13, 15, and 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and Articles 157 and 166(2) of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to General Data Protection Regulation ('the Code'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante stated that, according to the complaint, in order to participate in a professional training course, the complainant had been requested by the organisers to fill some forms, which, however, were in the name of T.S.M.. In addition, the Garante noted that the complainant had requested the organisers to provide explanations on the same, following which the complainant decided to submit to T.S.M. a request for the exercise of the right of access, the right to erasure, and the right to object. Subsequently, the Garante outlined that T.S.M. had confirmed to the complainant the deletion of their personal data from its archives, without providing the complainant with the information required under Article 15 of the GDPR and without ensuring that it had taken note of the complainant's objection to future processing.
Further to this, the Garante highlighted that T.S.M. had repeatedly failed to respond to requests for information and comments sent by the Garante, following which the Garante hadÂ initiatedÂ the procedure for the adoption of enforcement actions.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, based on the elements emerged in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that the forms in questions had required the complainant to attach a copy of their identity document and health card, but did not contain any information on the processing of personal data nor did they clarify the relationship between T.S.M. and the course organisers. Therefore, the Garante held that T.S.M. was in violation of Article 13 of the GDPR, as it had failed to clarify its role and the scope of the processing of personal data. In addition, the Garante deemed T.S.M. in breach of Articles 15 and 21 of the GDPR, having provided incomplete information to the complainant in response to their request for the exercise of their rights, thus making it impossible for the same to exercise those rights and depriving them of control over their personal data.
Notably, the Garante also found T.S.M. in breach of Articles 157 and 166(2) of the Code, for failure to respond to the requests for information and documents submitted by the Garante, thus hindering the investigation.
Given the above, the Garante imposed a fine and, in quantifying the same, the Garante considered, among other things, the repetitive nature of the omissive conduct of T.S.M. towards the Garante's requests, the duration of the violation of the complainant's rights, and the general lack of cooperation during the investigation.
In addition, the Garante:
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine, warning, prohibition, and orders, and highlighted that T.S.M. may, within 30 days, lodge an appeal before the judicial authority.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante stated that Labour Inspectorate Unit had reported the presence ofÂ two CCTV cameras, placed inside Villa Masi, and that the information signs prescribed by Article 13 of the GDPR were not displayed. In addition, the Garante noted that, on the basis of the report, it had notified Villa Masi of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative sanction, and that subsequently, in the course of a hearing requested by Villa Masi, the same had declared that the two CCTV cameras have been removed.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, upon examination of the documentation produced, the Garante determined that, at the time of the checks carried out by the Labour Inspectorate Unit, the two CCTV cameras installed were in operation and that the information signs had not been affixed, resulting in a breach of Article 13 of the GDPR.
In light of the violation occurred, the Garante imposed a fine, and in quantifying the same, it took into account, among other things, the absence of previous violations and the cooperation of Villa Masi in the course of the investigation and proceeding.Â 
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine, and highlighted that Villa Masi has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. In addition, the Garante noted that Villa Masi may, within the same timeframe, lodge an appeal before the judicial authority.Â Moreover, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.

'''The Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform published, on 16 June 2021, a report containing recommendations to the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on how the UK can reshape its approach to regulation and seize new opportunities from Brexit. In particular, the Taskforce was formed upon request by Johnson, in order to identify and develop proposals across a range of areas driving innovation, growth, and competitiveness through regulatory reform. Notably, the report calls for a new data protection framework, a UK Framework of Citizen Data Rights, to replace the UK General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), describing it as unnecessarily restricting the use of data for worthwhile purposes.
More specifically, the report proposes reform to give stronger rights and powers to consumers and citizens, placing responsibility on the companies using data, and freeing up data for innovation and in the public interest. Furthermore, the report indicates concerns that the UK GDPR needs to be revised for artificial intelligence and growth sectors to enable innovation in the UK. To this end, the report suggests that Article 22 of the UK GDPR should be removed to allow focus on the legitimacy of automated decision-making.

The ACMA outlined that it received numerous consumer complaints regarding calls made to consumers listed on the Do Not Call Register ('DNCR'), who alleged receiving calls from the Wine Group despite not having consented to these.Â In addition, the ACMA noted thatÂ it had also received numerous complaints regarding the receipt of unsolicited CEMs, from which the recipients were unable to unsubscribe.
Findings of the ACMA
In particular, the ACMA found thatÂ the Wine Group CEMs were sent on 59 occasions, between 1 February and 17 May 2021, without the consent of the relevant electronic account-holders. Furthermore, the ACMA added thatÂ it had found the Wine Group caused CEMs to be sent in the same period without containing a functional unsubscribe facility, as well as continuing to send these after requests from the recipient to unsubscribe.
In addition, the ACMA confirmed thatÂ the Wine Group made 20 telemarketing calls to numbers on the DNCR without consent, in addition to making such calls to numbers from which they had received an unsubscribe request, between 2 February and 18 May 2021.
Finally, the ACMA found that, between 3 February and 27 April 2021, the Wine Group had not immediately terminated calls upon the request of the recipient, despite multiple indications that the recipient did not want to continue the call. In addition, the ACMA noted that the Wine Group had also not provided, upon request of the recipient, the details of any person responsible for dealing with inquiries or complaints about the caller.
As such, the ACMA confirmed that Section 16(1) of the Spam Act, Section 11(1) of the DNCR Act,Â and Section 128(1) of the Telecommunications Act were contravened by the Wine Group.
Outcomes
Resultantly, the ACMA issued two fines of AUD 39,960 (approx. â‚¬26,380) each, and a fine of AUD 124,320 (approx. â‚¬82,080) on the Wine Group, to be paid by 15 April 2022.

In particular, AOK Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg organised several online lotteries and collected personal data of the participants as well as their health insurance affiliation. Moreover, the LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg held that with the help of technical and organisational measures, including internal guidelines and data protection training, AOK Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg had aimed to ensure that only data from those contestants who had previously given their effective consent were used for advertising purposes. However, the LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg found that the measures defined by AOK Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg did not meet the legal requirements and that as a result, the personal data of more than 500 competition participants were used without their consent for advertising purposes.

Background to the decision
In particular, the LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg stated that a property owner in a new development area had received a letter from a property development company with a purchase price offer for their property. More specifically, the LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg noted that the letter did not contain any information about the origin of the property owner's data.
Findings of the LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg
In its investigation, the LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg found that a surveyor had made use of their authorisation to inspect the electronic land register, identified several hundred property owners without their knowledge, and passed on the relevant information to a property development company, who, in turn, contacted property owners. In this regard, the LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg held that property owners could neither object to the entry in the land register, nor to the transmission of their data, this procedure thus violating Article 6(1) of the GPDR.
Furthermore, the LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg stated that property owners were not provided with any information on the processing of their data, even when they were contacted by the property development company, which constituted a violation of Article 14 of the GDPR.

Facts of the Decision
The question had arisenÂ in the context of aÂ tenderÂ process for the procurement of software for digital services, wherebyÂ anÂ unsuccessfulÂ bidderÂ had challenged the award of the contract to the successful bidder,Â due to its failure to comply with data protection laws.

The chamber reviewed the bid and noted that the data protection violations that the successful bidder had been accused ofÂ concern Article 44 
Findings of the Chamber
In this regard, the chamber found thatÂ a transfer of personal data to a third country is unlawful under data protection law if the relevant server is operated by a company based in the EU, which is also part of a US group. As such, the chamberÂ held that the 'mere possibility' that personal data can be accessed by theÂ USÂ parent company leads to a transferÂ within the meaning of the GDPR, regardless of whether the US parent company actually accesses the personal data.
Notably,Â OneTrust DataGuidanceÂ confirmed this development withÂ Philipp Quiel, Counsel at Piltz Legal, who commentedÂ that, ''on one hand, it may be possible that the legal provisions dealing with the procurement procedure may include the need to make a prognostic decision. However, this is not a question relating to data protection law. On the other hand, the chamber specifically decided that using the relevant service is a violation against data protection law because using the service entails an unlawful data transfer in accordance with ArticleÂ 44 
Moreover, Quiel outlined that ''the European Data Protection Board ('EDPB')Â seems to also think that a data transfer already occurs where an access to data is provided regardless if the access possibility was indeed used to access data''.Â 
Quiel also noted that, ''to ourÂ understanding, a data transfer in terms of ArticleÂ 44 
Quiel concluded, however, that ''in the case the chamber decided on, it was contractually agreed that for certain purposes data transfers were foreseen. Therefore, it is still true that no data was actually transferred but one must also acknowledge that it was agreed that data may be transferred to third countries for certain purposes''.

LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg releases statement onÂ Public Procurement Chamber's decision
The Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg data protection authorityÂ ('LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg')Â issued, on 15 August 2022, a statement addressing the decision of theÂ Public Procurement Chamber issed on 13 July 2022.Â In particular, theÂ LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg noted that the decision bears a significance that goesÂ beyond the initial case, which resulted from an official procurement procedure.Â However, the LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg highlighted that the decision should be viewed critically for the following reasons:
In light of the above, theÂ LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg took the view thatÂ the provisions of its orientation guide on data transfers remainÂ valid even after theÂ decision of the Public Procurement Chamber, and outlined that individual case-related alternative tests, and not blanket transfer bans, are still the means of choice to implement the specifications of the GDPR in the best possible way.

Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg: Public Procurement Chamber's decision rendering use of EU subsidiary of US group unlawful overturned
The Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court ('the Court') issued, on 7 September 2022, its decision in Case No. 15 Verg 8/22, in which it overturned a lower court's decision, namely,Â theÂ Public Procurement Chamber'sÂ decision of 13 July 2022, to rejectÂ an unsuccessful bidder's request for review of the tender award, following an appeal on the same.Â 
Background to the case
In particular, the Court stated that, at the request of an unsuccessful bidder in aÂ procurement procedureÂ for a review of the tender award, the lower court hadÂ decided that the successful bidder should be excluded from the procurement processÂ due toÂ its violation ofÂ theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), whichÂ rendered the bidÂ incompatibleÂ withÂ the requirements of theÂ tenderÂ documents. In this regard, theÂ Court further noted that such a decision was made since the lower court considered thatÂ the successful bidder's use of a Luxembourg subsidiary of a US group as a service providerÂ inÂ itsÂ bid gave rise to the possibilityÂ that personal data can be accessed by theÂ USÂ parent company, leading to a 'transfer' within the meaning of the GDPR, regardless of whether the US parent company actually accesses the personal data.Â 
Findings of the Court
Notably, the Court upheld the appeal lodged against the lower court's decision and found that since the successful bidder hadÂ made clear assurances about the content of the contract between it and the Luxembourg service provider, which iterated thatÂ data may only be transmitted toÂ theÂ LuxembourgÂ subsidiary,Â processed solely byÂ itÂ without exception, and processed only in Germany,Â itÂ couldÂ be assumedÂ thatÂ the bidderÂ will fulfilÂ the contractual commitments specified. As such, the Court explainedÂ that it shouldÂ not beÂ assumedÂ that due to the group affiliation tying the subsidiary to the US, the subsidiary would receive or follow illegal instructions from the US parent company. Consequently, the Court noted thatÂ the bid hadÂ not deviated from the data protection and IT security requirementsÂ specifiedÂ in the tender and thatÂ therefore there was no reason to excludeÂ the successful bidder'sÂ offer from the award procedure.Â 
Outcomes
Ultimately, the CourtÂ overturned the lower court's decision and rejected the application to exclude the successful bidder's offer from the award procedure. In this regard, the Court noted that its decision is final.Â

'''The Stuttgart Social Court issued, on 27 January 2022, its judgment in Case S 24 KA 166/20, where the Court dismissed the lawsuit concerning the plaintiff'sÂ allegationÂ that Section 291(2b) of theÂ  Social Code Book V of 20 December 1988 ('SGB V') imposing obligations on contract doctors with respect to connecting to the telematics infrastructure ('TI') is incompatible with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').
Background to the case Â 
In particular, the Court stated that the parties involved had been in dispute about the plaintiff doctor's fee reduction, due to the plaintiff's failure to connectÂ to the TI and the associated failure to perform the insurance master data comparison ('VSD'). In addition, the Court outlined that the TI was created in accordance with the requirements of the legislator in order to better connect all those involved in the health care system, noting that the aim is to have faster, more comprehensive, and more effective access to medical information than before, which will benefit the quality and efficiency of the health care system.
Furthermore, the Court stated that the TI is a closed network, to which only registered users with an electronic ID card have access. Moreover, the Court noted that the aim is to create a communication infrastructure in the health care system for the secure exchange of important medical data. Additionally, the Court stated that according to Section 291of the SGB V, the group of service providers for whom a connection to the TI is mandatory also includes contract doctors, noting that the service providers are obliged to create the necessary conditions in order to be able to use the services provided by the health insurance funds to check the validity of the insured person's data and that the data is up to date. Â 
However, the Court noted that the plaintiff lodged a complaint alleging, among other things, that the use of the TI component connector, at least in its current form, violates the provisions of the GDPR.
Findings of the Court 
In particular, the Court noted that Article 6(1) of the GDPR permits the processing of personal data, among other things, if it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or if it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In addition, the Court stated that in this case, the processing of the data is carried out pursuant to Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR, i.e. for the performance of a task that is in the public interest. Furthermore, the Court held that the data processing associated with the VSD comparison also complies with the principle of proportionality according to Article 6(3) of the GDPR. Moreover,Â the Court stated that the processing of data in the VSD comparison is also compatible with Article 9 of the GDPR, noting that the exemption to the prohibition to process sensitive data in Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR applies, because the processing is necessary for care or treatment in the health or social sector or for the management of systems and services in the health or social sector. Furthermore, the Court highlighted that the legislator has taken sufficient precautions to ensure data security in connection with the electronic health card and the TI in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Court held that the contested Section 291(2b) of theÂ SGB VÂ is fundamentally compatible with the GDPR, and thus dismissed the lawsuit.

'''The Administrative Court ofÂ Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg ('VGHÂ Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg') issued, on 25 June 2020, a decision ('the Decision') stating that restaurants' collection of personal dataÂ during the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic is constitutional and compatible with theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Decision notes that the plaintiff opposedÂ Section 2(3) of the Ordinance of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Economics for Curbing Transmissions of CoronavirusÂ in Restaurants ('the Ordinance') asÂ customers are only allowed to visit restaurants if they provide the operator with certain personal contact details completely and correctly. Furthermore, the plaintiff argued thatÂ Section 2(3) of the Ordinance violatesÂ ArticleÂ 9(1) of theÂ GDPR, whichÂ stipulates that the processing of personal data, including racial and ethnic origin, is prohibited, and that such information is regularly revealed by the data subject's name and address. In addition, the plaintiff argued that the Ordinance violated ArticleÂ 5 of the GDPR, as the measure was not necessary and appropriate for the purpose, the data storage period is too long, and the data subjects have no security with regard to their personal data. The plaintiff further argued, among other things, that,Â due to the high fluctuation in personnel in the catering trade, a large number of people could gain access to the data, furthermore highlighting that, asÂ restaurant staff tend not to beÂ trained in data protection, there is no adequate protection of personal data.
However, the VGHÂ Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg noted, in its Decision, that the processing of data under the Ordinance would not be prohibited by ArticleÂ 9(1) of theÂ GDPR , as such processing is permitted under ArticleÂ 9(2)(h) of the GDPR, because it is for the purpose of health care and, additionally, itÂ meets the requirements of ArticleÂ 9(3) of the GDPR because itÂ takes place exclusively for the purpose of providing information to the health department or the local police authority in order to carry out their sovereign duties in accordance with Sections 16 and 25 of the Infection Protection Law ('IfSG'). TheÂ VGHÂ Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg highlightedÂ that, in any case, it is doubtful thatÂ the data to be processed under Section 2(3) of the Ordinance is data within the meaning of ArticleÂ 9(1) of the GDPR.Â Moreover, the VGHÂ Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg held that Section 2(3)(3) of theÂ Ordinance explicitly provides that the general provisions on the processing of personal data under the GDPR,Â including those concerning the security and confidentiality of processed data, remain unaffected by the Ordinance, and therefore, the Ordinance is not incompatible withÂ Article 5 of the GDPR.Â

Background to the case
In particular, the Belgian DPA initiated an investigation on its own initiative following various media reports on the use of thermal cameras for the purposes of combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. The Belgian DPA noted that thermal screening had taken place at BSCA between June 2020 and March 2021 and that BAC engaged Ambuce Rescue Team to effectuate a second temperature screening of those found to have a temperature above 38Â°C, whereby the individual would also be examined for additional symptoms of COVID-19 by a medical expert and a findings report would be issued.
Findings of the Belgian DPA
Consequently, the Litigation Chamber of the Belgian DPA found that BAC had violated Articles 5(1)(c), 6(1)(e), and 9(2)(g) of the GDPR for failing to indicate from the beginning of the Belgian DPA's investigation on which legal basis it processed the personal data. Furthermore, the Belgian DPA determined that BAC had violated ArticleÂ 12 in conjunction with Articles 13(1)(c) and 13(2)(e) of the GDPR, since BAC's privacy policy did not explicitly state the legal basis upon which it relied for processing personal data through thermal cameras.
Simultaneously, the Litigation Chamber of the Belgian DPA outlined that the Ambuce Rescue Team had violated Articles 5(1)(c), 6(1)(e), and 9(2)(g) of the GDPR, as it had failed to demonstrate that the processing of personal data was necessary for the reasons of public interest. In addition, the Litigation Chamber of the Belgian DPA determined that the Ambuce Rescue Team had violated Articles 35(1)( and 35(3) of the GDPR, as it had not performed a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') on the risks of processing of personal data.
Outcomes
Ultimately, the Belgian DPA imposed the two aforementioned fines, totalling â‚¬220,000, on both defendants, as well as a reprimand to BAC.

Background to the case
In particular, the Belgian DPA initiated an investigation on its own initiative following various reports on the use of thermal cameras for the purposes of combatting the COVID-19 pandemic in the media. The Belgian DPA noted that thermal screening had taken place at Brussels South Charleroi Airport between June 2020 and March 2021.
Findings of the Belgian DPA
Consequently, the Belgian DPA outlined that theirÂ Inspection Service determined Brussels South Charleroi Airport to be in violation of the principles ofÂ  lawfulness and necessity, purpose limitation, and transparency, as well as failing in its obligations related to information provision, conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') prior to commencing data processing activities, implementingÂ  technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of personal data, Privacy by Design, maintaining records of processing activities, and the independence of the data protection officer ('DPO'). However, the Belgian DPA added that the Litigation Chamber diverted from the Inspection Service's findings in that it found no violation of the principle of data minimisation or the principles of Privacy by Design, as the purposes for processing were to ensure the health and safety of all persons passing through the airport, and thus such processing did not concern only passengers.
More specifically, the Belgian DPA noted that the Litigation Chamber found that Brussels South Charleroi Airport had violated the following Articles of the GDPR:
Although the Belgian DPA acknowledged the pace with which certain authorities were required to make decision in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it outlined that this did not remove obligations to ensure compliance with the GDPR and related data protection legislation.

'''The Belgian Data Protection Authority ('the Belgian DPA') issued, on 14 July 2020, a decision in which it fined Google Belgium SA â‚¬600,000, its highest fine to date, following Google's refusal of a Belgian citizen's request to be dereferenced from outdated articles considered to be seriously damaging to their reputation, as well as a lack of transparency in Google's form for dereferencing requests. In particular, the Belgian DPA agreed that certain articles pertaining to the individual's relation to certain political parties, given their public role, were of public interest and could remain online. However, the Belgian DPA found that articles concerning unfounded harassment complaints could have serious repercussions for the individual and Google Belgium was therefore negligent in refusing this request for dereferencing. As a result, the Belgian DPA imposed a fine of â‚¬500,000 for violations of Articles 17 (1)(a) and 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), as well as a fine of â‚¬100,000 for violation of Article 12(1)(4) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the Belgian DPA requested that Google Belgium both remove the concerned articles and adapt, within two months of the issuance of the decision, its forms for dereferencing requests in order to provide more clarity as to which entity acts as data controller for which processing activities.Â 
In addition, in terms of the Belgian DPA's jurisdiction, the Belgian DPA found that, despite Google claiming that the complaint has no basis since it was brought against Google Belgium while the data controller is Google LLC, the activities of Google Belgium and Google LLC are inextricably linked and that, as a result, Google Belgium can be held responsible.

Background to the case
The Belgian DPA outlined that its Inspection Service had commenced a broad investigation into the use of cookies on websites operated by Belgian media companies, including Roularta.
Findings of the Belgian DPA
Further to the above, the Belgian DPA determined that the consent to processing of personal data through the use of cookies on the sites levif.be and knack.be, operated by Roularta, could not be considered valid. Specifically, the Belgian DPA found that cookies had been placed which were not strictly necessary prior to obtaining consent, and confirmed thatÂ cookies used for statistical purposes cannot be consideredÂ strictly necessary, andÂ are therefore subject to the consent requirement.
In addition, the Belgian DPA providedÂ that the consent to third-party cookies was ambiguous due to the use of pre-ticked boxes, and that consent could not be withdrawn as easily as it was provided.
Furthermore, the Belgian DPA found that Roularta's privacy policy containedÂ insufficient informationÂ regarding the use of cookies, that cookies were being stored for unjustified periods of time, and that the company had not complied with the requirement to allow data subjects toÂ withdraw their consent.

Findings of the Belgian DPA
Consequently, the Belgian DPA found an absence of evidence of consent being obtained from the vast majority of the lawyers referenced on the website. Â Furthermore, the Belgian DPA stated that, upon examination of the privacy policy, it had found specifically a lack of information regarding the identification of the data controller, purpose of processing, and retention periods for storage of personal data.
Moreover, the Belgian DPA also found thatÂ the fundamental rights and freedoms of the lawyers involved, who oppose the processing in question, weigh against the legitimate interests being alleged by operator of the websites in question. Further to this, the Belgian DPA added that the lawyers involved are listed on the two websites in question without knowledge, which added to the lack of legal basis, in addition to not complying with the data subjects' right to be informed.

Furthermore, the Belgian DPA also concluded thatÂ the personal data processed by the websites isÂ inaccurateÂ and the operator of the websites has not taken all reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of the lawyers' personal data used on the websites.

'''The Litigation Chamber of the Belgian Data Protection Authority ('Belgian DPA') issued, on 27 January 2022, its decision No. DOS-2018-04433, in which it imposed two fines totalling â‚¬3,900 to A.S.B.L. EU DisinfoLab, a non-profit organisation, and one of its founding members, Mr. Nicolas Vanderbiest, for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 5(1)(f), 5(2), 6(1), 9, 12, 14, 24, 28(3), 30, 32, 33(1), and 35 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the online publication of raw data on Twitter, Inc.
Background toÂ the decision
In particular, the Belgian DPA and the French data protection authority ('CNIL') had received, in August 2018, over 240 complaints following the publication of online of raw data, containing personal data, drawn from analysing tweets of 55,000 Twitter users concerning the Benalla affair, pertaining to an employee of the President of the Republic of France.
Findings of the Belgian DPA
Consequently, as part of the investigation, the Belgian DPA determined that two processing activities had taken place:
The investigation found various breaches of the GDPR related to both processing activities. More specifically, the Belgian DPA found that DisinfoLab had violated Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 6(1)(f), 12, 14, 24, 28(3), 30, 32, 33(1), and 35 of the GDPR for the first processing activity, and Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 5(1)(f), 6(1), 9, 12, 14, and 32 of the GDPR for the second.
However, the Belgian DPA considered that DisinfoLab acted as the data controller and, as such, Vanderbiest had limited liabiity in the context of the processing activities.
Outcomes
Ultimately, the Belgian DPA issued a reprimand and a fine of â‚¬2,700 to DisinfoLab for GDPR violations related to both processing activities. Furthermore, the Belgian DPA issued a reprimand and a fine of â‚¬1,200 to VanderbiestÂ for GDPR violations under the second processing activity. Additionally, the Belgian DPA decided to conclude the proceedings related to Articles 28 and 30 of the GDPR, given the short period between the violations, in August 2018,Â since the enforcement of the GDPR, in May 2018.

Background to theÂ decisionÂ 
In particular, the Belgian DPA noted that it had received a complaint from the general manager of an organisation in the transport sector regarding the receipt of multiple emails concerning a petition against the development of an underground line in Brussels, as sent by various petition-making organisations, including Change.org. Accordingly, the complainant alleged that Change.org did not have a legal basis to process their email address, and that Change.org had not provided sufficient information as would facilitate the exercise of their data subject rights, in line with the principle of transparency under the GDPR.
Findings of the Belgian DPA
In response, the decision notes that Change.org intended to rely upon legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing such personal data. However, the Belgian DPA found that legitimate interests could not be used as a legal basis for processing personal data in this instance, despite the pursuit of the legitimate right to petition, considering that the complainant was contacted on multiple occasions without the possibility to exercise their right to object. More specifically, the Belgian DPA noted that, within the emails in question, Change.org did not provide access to its privacy policy, contact details, or information on exercising the right to object.
Concerning the right to petition, the Belgian DPA determined that it dates back to 1831 and, as such, did not foresee the use of digital technologies to facilitate repeated and automated communications.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Belgian DPA ordered Change.org to update its privacy policy in order to reflect its responsibilities as joint data controller, and in light of this, to inform data subjects in each communication and in a transparent manner, of their data subject rights and to include a link to the privacy policy. Furthermore, the Belgian DPA requested that Change.org submit proof of having implemented such measures within three months.
In addition, the Belgian DPA determined that it would not have been appropriate to issue a monetary penalty in this case, but that publication of the decision would constitute a sufficient deterrent.

'''The Berlin data protection authority ('the Berlin Commissioner') announced, on 5 November 2019, that it had finedÂ Deutsche Wohnen SEÂ â‚¬14.5 million for violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') following on-site investigations. The Berlin Commissioner outlinedÂ that Deutsche Wohnen had stored tenantÂ personal data on an archivingÂ system from which it was impossible to delete such data, and that tenantÂ personal data had been stored without verifying if such data was permitted, or even required. In particular, the Berlin Commissioner highlighted that theÂ tenantÂ personal dataÂ included information on theÂ personal and financial circumstances of tenants, such as salary certificates, self-disclosure declarations, excerpts from employment and training contracts, tax, social, and healthÂ insurance data, and bank statements.
Furthermore, the Berlin Commissioner noted that, after its initial audit in 2017, it had issued an urgent recommendation to Deutsche Wohnen to change its archivingÂ system but that Deutsche Wohnen had not complied as ofÂ March 2019, following a second audit. The Berlin Commissioner stipulated that it therefore fined Deutsche Wohnen for violating Articles 25(1) and 5 of the GDPR on Privacy by Design and Default, and principles relating to processing of personal data betweenÂ May 2018 and March 2019. In addition, the Berlin Commissioner noted that the amount of the fineÂ was initially calculated to beÂ â‚¬28 million, as Deutsche Wohnen had reported sales of overÂ â‚¬1 billion in 2018. Mitigating factors in the calculation of the final amount included Deutsche Wohnen's cooperation and attempts to rectify the issue, but aggravating factors includedÂ the creationÂ of the offending archivingÂ systemÂ and that the affected data was processed inappropriately over a long period of time.Â 
The Berlin Commissioner concluded that the fining decision is not final, and that Deutsche Wohnen can appeal against the fine.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Berlin Commissioner stated that, in this context, the company had appointed a data protection officer ('DPO') to independently monitor decisions they had made in another capacity.

'''The Cottbus Administrative Court issued, on 4 February 2022, its judgment in Case VG 4 K 1191/19, where the Court dismissed the lawsuit relating to a contested fee notice issued by the defendant to the plaintiff as a result of complying withÂ the plaintiff's request to switch off the newly installed water meter containing a radio module, since the plaintiff alleged that the wireless water meter infringed their right to informational self-determination under Article 2(1) in conjunction with Article 1(1) of the Basic Law of 23 May 1949 ('GG') and to the inviolability of the home under Article 13 of the GG.
Background to the case Â 
In particular, the Court outlined that the plaintiff owns property that is supplied with water by the special-purpose association headed by the defendant. In addition, the Court stated that the defendant installed a new water meter on the plaintiff's property on 13 December 2018, which contains a radio module, which enables the meter reading to be transmitted at any time. However, the Court noted that the plaintiff contacted the defendant and objected to the installation of the wireless water meter alleging that theÂ meter infringed their right to informational self-determination under Article 2(1) in conjunction with Article 1(1) of the GG and to the inviolability of the home under Article 13 of the GG. Furthermore, the Court stated that after the plaintiff continued to request that the radio function be switched off, the defendant switched it off, however, the defendant issued the plaintiff an administrative fee notice for switching off the radio module. Moreover, the Court noted that the plaintiff filed a lawsuit after the defendant rejected the plaintiff's objection to the fee notice.
Findings of the Court 
In particular, the Court noted that the legality of the installation of a water meter with a radio module on a property for the purpose of charging user fees is not to be measured against the fundamental rights of the GG, but rather, complete harmonisation had occurred in this area of data collection through the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). Hence, the Court held that the legality of the installation must therefore be measured against the GDPR and the fundamental rights of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Furthermore, the Court held that the installation of a water meter with a radio module may already be considered data processing within the meaning of the GDPR. Moreover, the Court noted that in this case, the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, in accordance with Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR. Additionally, the Court held that Article 12(5) in conjunction with Article 18 of the GDPR does not preclude the charging of an administrative fee for the deactivation of the radio module of the water meter, if the association has decided on the subscriber's objection to the installation, and the subscriber in any case only objects in principle to the collection of data and does not invoke any grounds under Article 21(1) of the GDPR arising from their particular situation.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Court dismissed the lawsuit.

'''China's data protection laws are in a period of development and change. On 20 August 2021, the Chinese legisÂ­lator released the PIPL which will be effective as of 1 November 2021. The PIPL provides comprehensive measures, including civil protection and administrative regulations in the field of personal information. The PIPL, together with two other fundamental laws on cybersecurity and data protection, the Cybersecurity Law 2016 ('CSL') and the Data Security LawÂ ('DSL'), bring about a new data proÂ­tection legal regime in China. The CSL is the fundamental law regulating cyberspace, focusing on multi-level protection of cybersecurity, protection of critical information infrastructure, cybersecurity review, and inspection and certification of key network devices and special cybersecurity products. The DSL is the fundamental law regulating data security, focusing on regulating the categorisation and classification of data and protection of important data. The PIPL marks the introduction of a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information in China which does not merely incorporate or replace rules that are already enshrined in other Chinese laws, but also draws inspiration from the GDPR of the EU.
In this article, we will address several key legislative issues under the PIPL by undertaking a comparative analysis of the PIPL and the GDPR and assessing the similarities and differences between them. In particuÂ­lar, we will focus on the following points:
The definition of 'personal information' is a core and fundamental concept of the PIPL as it directly defines the scope of protection. Pursuant to Article 4, the PIPL defines 'personal information' as 'various types of electronic or otherwise recorded information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person,' which is generally consistent with the definition of 'personal information' under the CSL referring to 'various types of elecÂ­tronic or otherwise recorded information that can be used separately or in combination with other information to identify a natural person including but not limited to the name, date of birth, ID number, personal biometric information, address, phone number, etc. of natural persons.' Nevertheless, the use in the PIPL of the conÂ­cept of 'relating to' renders the coverage of personal information under that statute much broader in scope except anonymised information since such information does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person.
The core legal concept of personal information lies in 'the ability to identify the personal identity of a natural perÂ­son alone or in combination with other information'. Some scholars believe personal information includes inforÂ­mation that needs to be combined with other information to identify a natural person, i.e. 'indirect personal inÂ­formation'. In terms of 'identification', those components that can individually identify the personal information of natural persons are easier to define, for example the ID number or personal biometric information of a naturÂ­al person. However, understanding the indirect concept, 'in combination with other information', needs further discussion.
The term 'personal data' under the GDPR is broadly defined as any information relating to an identified or identiÂ­fiable natural person (data subject). Furthermore, it specifies 'an identifiable natural person as one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification numÂ­ber, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.' The wide interpretation of such definition is criticised as somewhat ambiguous, resulting in a potential uncertainty of interpretation. Thus, although the GDPR is more comprehensive and prescriptive than the PIPL, personal information as defined under the PIPL is more consistent in terms of practical application.
The PIPL recognises the category of 'personal sensitive information' as 'personal information that, once leaked or illegally used, may lead to personal discrimination or serious harm to personal and property safety, inÂ­cluding race, nationality, religious belief, personal biological features, medical history, health, financial account, personal whereabouts, specially-designated status, personal information of a minor under 14 years old and other information'. This category of data is subject to tighter restrictions on collection and processing.
Based on this definition, financial account information, and personal whereabouts will be treated as 'personal sensitive information'. However, it is worth noting that financial account information and personal whereabouts are regularly processed by personal information processors and these tight restrictions would hinder many comÂ­mon processing operations in practice. For instance, workplaces often process financial account information for payroll and salary purposes. Furthermore, financial account information is processed in the context of fraud preÂ­vention. The personal whereabouts of individuals is regularly processed in relation to various of location-based services, including rideshare, taxi services, GPS, and map applications, etc. The requirement of obtaining separate consent from data subjects to process such whereabouts information may prove overly burdensome for organisations and may raise concerns of 'consent fatigue' among individuals. Moreover, there is an open-ended category of 'other information' under the definition of 'personal sensitive information'. Given that it is not clear how to and who can define such 'other information', the inclusion of such a vague and broad category may create legal unÂ­certainty in practice.
Meanwhile, personal sensitive information is not defined under the GDPR. The GDPR does however recognise 'special category data' as 'data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beÂ­liefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual oriÂ­entation which is subject to tighter restrictions'. Processing of 'special category of personal data' under the GDPR adopts permissible methodologies based on the principle of prohibition and exception. The PIPL adopts similar approaches, such as specific restrictions and only processing as authorised for specific purposes and sufficient necessity, subject to obtaining the separate consent of the data subjects.
The PIPL describes 'personal information processors' as 'the organisations or individuals that independentÂ­ly determine the purposes, means and or any other matter relating to the processing of any personal informaÂ­tion', which are known as 'data controllers' in some other privacy laws. The GDPR provides concepts of conÂ­trollers and processors, controllers referring to 'the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law,' the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by EU or EU member State law, with processors reÂ­ferring to those who process data on behalf the controller. The GDPR distinguishes between the controller who has the right to determine the means and purposes of processing personal data and the processor who processÂ­es personal data on behalf of the controller. The data processor as defined under the PIPL is similar to the data controller under the GDPR.
A third party entrusted by the data processor to process personal information (e.g. a third-party service provider) under the PIPL is similar to the data processor under the GDPR. If data processors jointly determine how to process personal inforÂ­mation, they are considered as co-processors which shall bear joint liability in cases of infringement of personal interests under the PIPL.
Where a data processor entrusts a third party to process personal information, both parties generally shall exeÂ­cute an agreement that includes the purpose of data processing, the processing mode, the types of personal inÂ­formation processed, protection measures, and both parties' rights and liabilities. In these cases, the data proÂ­cessor is responsible under the PIPL for supervising the data processing activities. However, the PIPL does not list specific supervision methods. After completion of performance of the contract or termination of enÂ­trustment, personal information must be returned or deleted.
With respect to the role of a personal information processor, the GDPR provides a more prescriptive and specific defiÂ­nition than the PIPL.
The PIPL introduces 'automated decision-making' and specifically defines it as 'addressing personal inforÂ­mation to be automatically analysed and evaluated by means of computing algorithms for decision-making'. Data processors are required to ensure the transparency of the decision and the fairness of the result and prevented from exercising discriminated treatment for the trading conditions, e.g. price. In the event that data subjects consider the automated decision-making to have a significant impact on their interests, they are entitled to request that the data processor explain the situation, and the data subject has the right to refuse such automated means. The data processor conducting information push delivery or commercial sales to individuals through automated decision-making methods shall simultaneously provide the option to not target an individual's characteristics, or provide the individual with a convenient method to refuse.
Under the GDPR, automated decision-making and profiling ensure that the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of individuals are safeguarded where such processing leads to a legal and significant impact on an indiÂ­vidual, thus enhancing an individual's control over the use of personal data. The rights of data subjects may thus escape decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling which has legal effects or other sigÂ­nificant consequences. In accordance with general principles under the GDPR, automated decision-making is based upon the subject's right to be informed rather than being reviewed under the significant impact standard. The right to object relies on the data subject's active execution.
The GDPR defines profiling as 'any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of perÂ­sonal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict asÂ­pects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements', but does not provide a definition of automated decision-making, as in Article 73 of the PIPL. The PIPL merely focuses on the analysis and evaluation of profilÂ­ing processes, but does not address its predictive aspects. It appears that the PIPL's concept of profiling is intended to be included within the definition of automated decision-making; however, the profiling process is based solely on personal information, while the automated decision-making process does not rely only on perÂ­sonal information.
Extraterritorial or long-arm jurisdiction is applied under the PIPL. Pursuant to Article 3 of the PIPL, the law applies to the processing of personal information within the territory of the PRC, and also to cross-border processing activities of personal information of individuals in China if the purpose of the processing is:
Furthermore, the data processors which are located outside of China but governed by the PIPL are required to establish an entity or appoint a representative in charge of personal information protection. The name of the entity or name and contact information of the representative must be filed with the relevant Chinese authorities. In practice, a law firm in China could be designated as the representative for the data processor located outside of China.
The GDPR's territorial scope covers the processing of (i) personal data by an organisation established in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in EU, and (ii) data processors outside EU if that processing reÂ­lates to either offering goods or services to data subjects in the EU or monitoring the behaviour of data subjects, as far as their behaviour takes place within the EU. Thus, the PIPL is generally consistent with the GDPR reÂ­garding territorial scope but have some differences.
Personal information processing can be useful for individuals and organisations as well as for the economy and society as a whole. Benefits include the enhancement of efficiencies, resource saving, customisaÂ­tion of services and products, and optimisation of public governance. However, these processes may present significant challenges and threats for individuals' rights and freedoms. These processes can be used without the knowledge of the individuals concerned or their understanding of what is involved. Protection of personal information plays an important role in light of the fundamental right to respect for private life. Increasingly, high-tech capabiliÂ­ties are consistently breaching the privacy and autonomy of individuals.
In response to such risks, pursuant to Article 13 of the PIPL, data processors are permitted to process perÂ­sonal information solely based on:
Further, the PIPL provides a higher-level consent requirement, such as separate consent and written conÂ­sent, in several places. According to Article 14, any consent must be expressed by individuals voluntarily and exÂ­plicitly with full knowledge. Such requirements resemble the consent requirements under the GDPR, which deÂ­fines consent under Article 4(11) as any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. Although the PIPL introduces the above six legal grounds for processing, it is nonetheless the case that certain important forms of personal information processÂ­ing in the current era of Big Data may not be contained within the scope of such legal grounds.
Apart from consent, the processing grounds provided in the PIPL all relate to very specific information proÂ­cessing situations which are common in daily life. Though consent may be a legal basis for data processing, in many circumstances it would be impractical, impossible, or ineffective to obtain consent, either because there is no direct interaction with the data subject, or because it would be counterproductive to obtain consent if the data processing is for cybersecurity or prevention of crime.
The provisions of the GDPR governing lawfully processing of personal data are set out under six legal grounds as below:
The data processing activities must be based on at least one of above grounds. Under EU law, these legal bases carry equal weight. Note that in comparison to legal grounds for data processing under the GDPR, there is no leÂ­gal basis of the legitimate interest under the PIPL. A balancing test will be carried out to determine the priority between the legitimate interests of the data controller or the third party and the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. The legitimate interest ground for processing is not only essential for proÂ­cessing related to fraud and crime prevention.
Other processing scenarios that may be addressed by such a ground include information, network, system, and cybersecurity; corporate operations and due diligence investigation; product development and enhancement; communicaÂ­tions, marketing, and business intelligence. Indeed, in the growing data economy, the legitimate interest ground for processing will become increasingly important to enable a broad range of data processing activities not covÂ­ered by other grounds but essential for a well-functioning digital economy and for organisations' ability to innovate. On the other hand, given that the concept of legitimate interests might be very broadly interpreted in practice, the Chinese government may concern some data processers would misuse such concept. Therefore, the ground of legitimate interests is not written in the PIPL.

'''The PIPL establishes seven principles for data processing, including legality, propriety, necessity, and sincerity (Article 5), explicit purpose (ArtiÂ­cle 6), minimum necessity (Article 6), transparency (Article 7), accuracy (Article 8), accountability and data security (Article 9), and storage limitation (Article 19). The PIPL is similar to the GDPR in this respect. Under the GDPR, personal data processing is subject to the principles of lawfulness, transparency and fairness, further processing and purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality, and accountability. In any event, the principles of data protection still apply and serve as a boundary for abusive practices.
The PIPL provides extensive rights to data subjects. Pursuant to Article 44, data subjects have the right to know, right to decide on, and right to limit or object to, the processing of their personal information by others. Data subjects also have the right to access and copy their personal information from data processors and the right of data portability (Article 45) and the right to request that data processors correct or supplement their personal information (Article 46). Under certain circumstances, data subjects have the right to request deletion of their personal information and the right to withdraw consent (Article 47), and the right to request that the data processor explain the processing rules (ArtiÂ­cle 48).
On the other hand, the GDPR empowers similar fundamental rights for data subjects as those under the PIPL. The GDPR further provides for exceptions, in that 'the exercise of the right to data portability shall not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carÂ­ried out for the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, and shall not adverseÂ­ly affect the rights and freedoms of others'. These rights reflect the philosophy that the data subject or individual should maintain full control of one's personal data.
In addition, the PIPL provides the next of kin with the right to access to, copy, correct, delete, etc. the deceased's personal information unless provided otherwise by the deceased. The GDPR does not have similar provisions relating to the personal information of the deceased.
The PIPL enumerates the obligations of data processors with respect to data processing in an independent chapter. The obligations include establishing internal administrative policies and operating procedures, impleÂ­menting the classified administration of personal information, making operational limits for personal information processing, conducting regular training and education, establishing and imÂ­plementing contingency plans, adopting technical security measures such as anonymisation and encryption, and conducting regular audits of personal information processing activities.
According to Article 52 of the PIPL, if the volume of personal information processed reaches a threshold levÂ­el as stipulated by Chinese regulators, the data processor must appoint a data protection officer ('DPO') responsiÂ­ble for personal information processing.
The data processor is required to make an Personal Information Protection Impact Assessment ('PIPIA') in advance before processing sensitive personal inforÂ­mation, conducting cross-border transfer of personal information, performing automated decision-making based on personal information, processing personal information by a third party, providing processed personal information to a third party, and disclosing personal information publicly. Specifically, the PIPIA shall contain:
The PIPIA reports and records shall be preserved for at least three years.
The PIPL tracks most of the GDPR provisions related to the obligations of data processors, with the excepÂ­tion of notification of time limits. In cases of a data breach, the data processor is required to undertake remedial measures immediately and to notify the relevant regulator and data subjects. The PIPL provides the specific content to be included in the notification. If the measures taken by the data processor could effectively avoid damages caused by data breach, it is not necessary for the data processor to notify the data subjects unless the regulator determines otherwise.
Under the GDPR, the controller is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organisational meaÂ­sures, including appropriate data protection policies such as anonymising, pseudonymising, and encrypting data to ensure data processing in compliance with GDPR.
The GDPR also requires both controllers and processors to appoint a DPO in certain circumstances, such as where the processing is carried out by a public body, or where the organisation's core activities deal in large amounts of personal data, regular and systematic monitoring of individuals, or large scale processing of special categories or data/data relating to criminal convictions and offences.
The controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. The data controllers will bear responsibilities for the implementaÂ­tion of a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA'). Article 35 of the GDPR prescribes the obligation of a data controller to conduct DPIA prior to processing in order to assess the particular likelihood and severity of the risk, taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing and the sources of the risk. PurÂ­suant to Article 35(3)(a) of the GDPR, a DPIA is required in the case of a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person. That DPIA should include, in particular, the measures, safeguards, and mechanisms envisÂ­aged for mitigating that risk, ensuring the protection of personal data and demonstrating compliance with the GDPR.
Under the GDPR, notification must be provided no later than 72 hours after the event. In contrast, the PIPL requires 'immediate' notification without providing a specific time limit. Finally, the GDPR provides more compreÂ­hensive measures to ensure data protection such as adherence to codes of conduct and certification mechanisms.
A localisation requirement applies to critical information infrastructure operators ('CIIOs') and those data processors processing personal information of which the volume reach the threshold as stipulated. For CIIOs and such data processors, any necessary cross-border transfer of personal information shall be subject to a mandatory security assessment carried out by the Cyberspace Administration of China ('CAC').
For other general data processors, there are two routes for cross-border transfer of personal information:
For any cross-border transfer of personal information, in addition to the above compliance requirement, the data processor must also inform the data subjects of the identity and contact information of the overseas receiving party, the purpose of data processing, the processing mode, the type of personal information to be processed, and the way data subjects can exercise their rights provided under the PIPL, as well as obtain separate consent from the data subjects.
In terms of cross-border transfer of personal information for the purpose of providing international judicial asÂ­sistance and law enforcement assistance, the transfer shall be approved by a competent authority.
Under the PIPL, if an entity or individual infringes the personal information interests of Chinese citizens or if any nation or region adopts unreasonable measures towards China with respect to personal information protecÂ­tion, the CAC may take certain countermeasures.
Under the GDPR, a controller or processor may transfer personal data outside the EU without obtaining consent from the data subject, provided that adequate level of protection is ensured or appropriate safeguards are imÂ­plemented in the form of Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs'), Binding Corporate Rules ('BCRs'), compliance with Codes of Conduct, or certification schemes. In the absence of adequate levels of protection and appropriate safeguards, explicit consent from the data subject must be given to the proposed transfer. The mechanism of exÂ­ecution of transfer agreements under the PIPL may be similar to SCCs and certification by recognised instiÂ­tutions pursuant to the PIPL may be similar to 'approved certification mechanisms'. These standards will be subject to further analysis pending the release of implementation rules relating to the PIPL. The provision of Codes of Conduct and BCRs are not included in the PIPL for the purpose of data transfers to third countries.
The PIPL enlarges the range of penalties beyond those provided in the CSL. In addition to rectification, conÂ­fiscation of illegal gains, warnings, penalties under RMBÂ 1 million (approx. â‚¬126,300), business suspensions, busiÂ­ness halts for rectification, and the revocation of relevant permits or business licences under the CSL, the PIPL also stipulates that in serious cases, similar to the GDPR, data processors may be subject to fines up to RMB 50 million (approx. â‚¬6.3 million)Â or up to 5% of the prior year's revenue. The PIPL also imposes liability on any perÂ­son in charge or other directly liable individual for serious violations.
As for the GDPR, if data processors are challenged and subsequently upheld, controllers may face the highest penalties pursuant to Article 83(5) administrative fines up to â‚¬20 million, or up to 4% of the total worldwide anÂ­nual turnover of the preceding financial year. In addition, EU Member States may lay down their own regulations imposing penalties that apply to breaches of articles that are not subject to the fines under Article 83 of the GDPR.
Even though most parts of the eight perspectives above mentioned in the PIPL are similar with those under the GDPR, there are some differences in legal grounds, rights, obligations, and cross-border data transfers. While the GDPR provides a wide range of legal grounds as mentioned above, it is noted that the legitimate interests justiÂ­fication is not included in the PIPL. In addition to notification time limit in case of data breach, more measures are taken under the GDPR, such as adherence to codes of conduct or certification mechanisms in terms of obligations of data subjects. Regarding cross-border data transfers, the PIPL falls short of Codes of Conduct and BCRs; however, in some cases, the GDPR does not require the consent of the data subject for cross-border data transfers. It is noted that while some definitions vary between both laws, different wording expressÂ­es similar meanings: for instance, personal sensitive information in the PIPL is similar to special category data under the GDPR. The definition of automated decision-making is not provided in the GDPR and the profiling definition is included in the definition of automated decision-making without explicit description in the PIPL.
In the current era, the development of advanced technology and the capabilities of Big Data analytics enable data storage stronger and data transmission and computing power faster, so as to facilitate the collection of more perÂ­sonal information than before. Data processing is widely applied in both private and public sectors such as bankÂ­ing and finance, healthcare, taxation, insurance, marketing and advertising, etc. as well as in Big Data technology, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things devices. Although the benefits are obvious, the accompanying chalÂ­lenges and threats are attracting increased attention from competent authorities. The PIPL has adopted and referenced the GDPR while reflecting particular Chinese characteristics.
As a single unified and integrated personal information protection law in China, the PIPL will play a vital and comprehensive role in governing and regulating personal information protection in China in the very near future. Together with CSL and the DSL, the PIPL will bring about a relatively complete data protection legal framework in China.

'''The Colombian data protection authority ('SIC') published, on 3 March 2021, Resolution No. 10370 of 2021, in which it imposed a fine of COP 47,200,400 (approx. â‚¬10,720) on Asesores JurÃ­dicos e Inmobiliarios Remates y CesionesÂ S.A.S., for violations of Articles 4, 9, and 17 of the Statutory Law 1581 of 2012 (October 17) Which Issues General Provisions for the Protection of Personal Data ('the Data Protection Law') in conjunction with Decree No. 1074 of 2015, following an individual's complaint.
Background to the case
In particular, the SIC detailed that it had initiated an administrative investigation after becomingÂ aware of the alleged violations of Asesores JurÃ­dicos e Inmobiliarios, following an individual's complaint of having been contacted by the company to offer advice after stating that it was aware that the individual was part of an executive process. The SIC outlines that the individual had complained about the use of their personal data by a company for commercial purposes, something for which the individual had not given their consent, and although the company claimed that the personal data was publicly available, the individual claimed otherwise.Â 
Findings of the SIC
With respect to the collection and processing of personal data, the SIC found that although Asesores JurÃ­dicos e InmobiliariosÂ alleged it had processed data obtained from a public judicial file, and was therefore not required to obtain consent because of the public nature of the data, not all of the data processed by the company was present in the judicial file. As such, the SIC determined that Asesores JurÃ­dicos e Inmobiliarios Remates y Cesiones had processed personal data without first obtaining the required consent of the individual, and also did not store any such consent for the processing of the data.Â 
Regarding the obligation to inform data subjects about the processing of their personal data, the SIC found that Asesores JurÃ­dicos e Inmobiliarios did not provide the appropriate notice to the data subject. Specifically, the SIC detailed that Asesores JurÃ­dicos e Inmobiliarios had collected the personal data from the judicial file, stored the data, used the data for the offering of commercial services, and only after this contact with the data subject, did the same become aware of the processing of their data, a fact which must be communicated at the time of processing.
Finally, the SIC also found Asesores JurÃ­dicos e Inmobiliarios to be in breach of its obligation to comply with orders from the SIC, after the SIC requested certain information to be presented as part of its investigation, and to which the company did not respond.
Outcomes
As a result, the SIC issued a fine of COP 47,200,400 (approx. â‚¬10,720) to Asesores JurÃ­dicos e Inmobiliarios for failing to obtain and keep a record of the consent of a data subject prior to the processing of their personal data, failing to give notice to the data subject about the purposes for the processing of their personal data and to do so in a timely manner, and breaching its obligation to comply with orders from the SIC as part of the investigation.
In addition, the SIC ordered Asesores JurÃ­dicos e Inmobiliarios to delete the personal data of the individual, as well as data obtained from the judicial file, as well as all other data of other data subjects where data is obtained without consent, and to refrain from further processing of non-public data in such a manner.

Villas, such measures included:
Findings of the SIC
The SIC found that Banco Comercial AV. Villas had failed to demonstrate compliance as required under Resolution No. 61498 ofÂ 7 November 2019.
However,Â despite the presentation of the data subject claim, on 13 February 2020 and also the request made by SIC, on 28 May 28 2020, Banco Comercial AV. VillasÂ did not initiate any type of investigation related to the events reported by the complainant, only disciplinary actions were initiated once information was requested by SIC, as indicated during the investigations. Furthermore,Â thus, the excuses raised by the Banco Comercial AV. Villas, are not received by SICÂ to the extent that the same actions that began in June 2020, should have been carried out since on February, where the Banco Comercial AV. Villas couldÂ have respondÂ favorably or not to the complainant's request directly.
Outcome
Finally, the SIC imposed the aforementioned fine against the Banco Comercial AV. Villas, ordering that the payment should be settled within five business days, and, once this term expires, interest will be charged for each subsequent day of delay, settled until the amount of 12% annually.

Background to the case
The SIC outlined that, on 23 October 2018, the complainant sent a letter to Bimbo, requesting answers on the use of video-surveillanceÂ at Bimbo, seeking information on the data controller under the Data Protection Law, the confidentiality of the footage, and the lack of consent for the use of cameras. The complainant further noted that Bimbo failed to respond to the letter, following which, on 14 August 2018, the petition to the SIC was made.
Findings of the SIC
The SIC found that Bimbo usedÂ alternative means to obtain the authorisation of the collection of personal dataÂ prior to the entry into force of the Data Protection Law, as it published a notice in a newspaper informing the purpose of the processing of the collected data. Moreover, the SIC noted that following its investigation, it was proven that Bimbo did not respond to the requestsÂ within the established legal term,Â waiting nearly a year to respond to the claims presented by the data subjects, thus violating the duty to process queries and claims established by the Data Protection Law.

'''The Colombian data protection authority ('SIC') published, on 8 March 2021, Resolution No. 11511 of 2021, in which it imposed a fine of COP 50,831,200 (approx. â‚¬11,510) on Bler S.A.S. for violations of Articles 4, 9, and 17 of Statutory Law 1581 of 2012 (October 17) Which Issues General Provisions for the Protection of Personal Data ('the Data Protection Law') in conjunction with Decree No. 1074 of 2015.
Background to the resolution
In particular, the SIC detailed that the resolution stemmed from an individual having received a telephone call on their private mobile number, advertising the possibility to buy products and receive a voucher, although the individual stated that their mobile phone number was for personal use and for contact with their bank in line with the individual's agreement with the bank for their credit card.Â 
The SIC further stated that it had inquired with the individual's bank to assess whether an agreement was in place with Bler for the sharing of the data of customers, but the bank noted that it did not have an agreement with Bler, and that Bler stated that it had not shared the individual's personal information. As such, the SIC investigated the protection of the individuals personal and financial data, as Bler was processing the data and contacted the individual without first obtaining their consent to process their data and contact them.
Findings of the SIC
The SIC found that Bler did not have a policy in place with the individual's bank through which it could have obtained the individual's data. In addition, the SIC highlighted that as Bler had made the call to the individual, it was processing the personal data even before the initiation of the call, without consent, and further did not obtain consent upon the initial contact with the individual. Moreover, the SIC stated that Bler was unable to provide evidence of having obtained the express and informed consent of the individual, thereby also violating the obligation to maintain and keep consent.
Outcomes
As a result, the SIC issued a fine of COP 50,831,200 (approx. â‚¬11,510) to Bler for infringing their duties under the Data Protection Law to obtain and demonstrate by any means that it had obtained the prior express and informed consent to carry out the processing of personal data related to the collection and storage of the contact telephone number, name, and financial statements of the individual. In addition, the SIC ordered Bler to implement effective procedures to fulfil the duty of requesting and keeping proof of consent for the processing of personal data, as well as to cease the processing of data from individuals who have not given their consent.Â

Background to the case
In particular, the SIC stated that in line with itsÂ administration of the National Public Registry of Databases ('RNBD'), it noted that Cajiao Ospina had not provided any information on whether it had implemented any security measures to protect personal data as required under the RNBD questionnaire it submitted. As such, the SIC stated thatÂ it had requestedÂ Cajiao Ospinato in Resolution No. 61432 of 7 November 2019 to implement and monitor an information security policy that contains technical and organisational measures necessary to provide security to the personal data within six months of execution of the resolution.
Findings of the SIC

Background to the caseÂ 
In particular, the SIC explained that the Calzado Terrano was notified of Resolution No. 61443, which ordered them to document, implement, and monitor an information security policy containing technical, human, and administrative measures necessary to provide the security of personal data in order to avoid its adulteration, loss, unauthorised consultation, use, or access. Nonetheless, considering the termÂ issued by the SICÂ to comply with the orders, CalzadoÂ Terrano remained inactive.
Findings of the SICÂ 
During its investigation, the SIC established that Calzado Terrano violated Article 17(o) of the Data Protection Law, which obliges covered entities to comply with the instructions and requirements issued by the SIC, in accordanceÂ to Article 21(f) of the Data Protection Law, which provides the SIC with the power to requestÂ information from the data controllers and processorsÂ that is necessary for the effective exercise of its functions.

Background to the caseÂ 
In particular, the SIC explained that CEDIMÂ was notified of Resolution No. 61472, which ordered them to document, implement, and monitor an information security policy containing technical, human, and administrative measures necessary to provide security of personal data in order to avoid its adulteration, loss, unauthorised consultation, use, or access. Nonetheless, considering the term established to comply with the orders issued by theÂ SIC, the defendant party remained inactive.
Findings of the SICÂ 
During its investigation, SICÂ determined that CEDIM was duly notified of Resolution No. 61472 and rejected CEDIM's allegation of an invalid notification. Moreover, the SIC stated thatÂ it is clear that CEDIM does not accredit effective compliance with the principle of responsibility, as demonstrated through the documents it providedÂ as part of the personal data processing policy. In addition, the SIC noted that CEDIM did not have in place any appropriate and effective measures to comply with the obligations set out in the Data Protection Law, stating that such measures must be proportionate to:
Lastly, the SIC analysed the extent of the the harm or danger toÂ data subjects' rights, as well as the possible economic benefit of the defendant, in order to then analyse other concurrent circumstances, such as the economic capacity of the defendant, the recurrence of the offence, and the collaboration of the defendant with the SIC. In this respect, the SIC noted thatÂ the defendant did not obtain any economic benefit from the commission of the infringement, that there was no reiteration in the commission of the infringement, nor resistance or obstruction to the SIC's investigation.
Outcomes
Therefore, the SIC imposed a fine of COP 24,689,440 (approx. â‚¬5,550) to CEDIM, for violations of Articles 17(o) and 21(f) of the Data Protection Law. Finally, the SIC imposed the aforementioned fine and noted that appeals may be made against the resolution.Â

COP 702,000,000 (approx. â‚¬171,400) for including information that was not of a financial or credit nature in the creditÂ history of 288,753 Colombians. In particular, SIC highlighted that the case was forwarded by the Criminal Cassation Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia, where a citizen had complained that he was denied credit because his credit file included information related to a previous suspension of his civil and political rights. Furthermore, SIC noted that, during the investigation, it determined that Cifin had included similar informationÂ in the credit history of 288,753 citizens, and outlined that information that is not financial or credit cannot be included in the credit history of citizens, as it is consideredÂ unjustified and discriminatory.

In its first decision, SIC finedÂ Estratego MarketingÂ COP 9,374,904 (approx. â‚¬2,670) for processing a data subject's personal data without their consent in order to telemarket to them. ThoughÂ Estratego Marketing had claimed that it called telephone numbers at random, and that itÂ did not process any personal data until the data subject consented to a second call, SIC stated that the use of personal data, not merely its recording, constitutes processing and that the company should have obtained the data subject's consent to do so.Â

'''The Colombian data protection authority ('SIC') published, on 31 March 2021, Resolution No. 18303 of 2021, in which it imposed a fine of COP 30,063,024 (approx. â‚¬6,790) to Eclecticus S.A., for violations of Articles 4, 9, 12, and 17 of Statutory Law 1581 of 2012 (October 17) Which Issues General Provisions for the Protection of Personal Data ('the Data Protection Law') in conjunction with Decree No. 1074 of 2015.
Background to the case
In particular, the SIC noted that it had received an anonymous complaint on 7 June 2019 from the Financial Superintendence of Colombia, urging the investigation of the www.guiavital.com website for allegedly violatingÂ the Data Protection Law. Specifically, the SIC detailed that the anonymous complaint stated that the website offers credits through third parties, but requires that personal and financial information be disclosed, which is then further used to validate whether an individual can obtain a credit.
Findings of the SIC
Following the SIC's investigation of the website, it found that the website did not have a mechanism for individuals to grant their consent, and to have knowledge of the purposes for which the data is processed. In addition, the SIC highlighted that Eclecticus, through its website, did not comply with the obligation to keep a record of consent given, and also did not have an information processing policy on its website, which contained the minimum necessary requirements to inform data subjects of the processing of their personal data.
Outcomes
As a result, the SIC issued the aforementioned penalty and also ordered Eclecticus to suspend any activities of processing of personal data for a period of three months until it proves that it has implemented anÂ effective mechanism to obtain consent and to permanently delete personal data obtained without consent. The SIC also ordered EclecticusÂ to provide a copy of the form used to obtain consent, provide evidence of the deleted data, implement a mechanism to inform individuals on the purposes of processing personal data and provide this prior to collecting data, and to develop an information processing policy that complies with the minimum requirements of information to be detailed in such a policy.

'''The Colombian data protection authority ('SIC') published, on 30 June 2021, Resolution No. 40810 of 2021, in which it assessed a previously applied penalty following an inspection visit to EDIFICIO ESTUDIO 59-PROPIEDAD HORIZONTAL, and imposed a fine of COP 2,723,100 (approx. â‚¬620) for violations of Articles 17 and 25 of Statutory Law 1581 of 2012 (October 17) Which Issues General Provisions for the Protection of Personal Data ('the Data Protection Law') in conjunction with Decree No. 1074 ('Decree 1074').
Background to the resolution
In particular, the SIC noted that on 29 February 2019 it had made an inspection visit to EDIFICIO ESTUDIO with the purpose of verifying its compliance with the Data Protection Law and DecreeÂ 1074. Following the inspection, the SIC noted that EDIFICIO ESTUDIO did not have, at the time of the inspection, policies for data processing, security policies, claims and inquiries, and procedures for processing personal data. Moreover, the SIC highlighted that entering the premises required the completion of a form by which personal data is collected, and at a concierge monitored through video surveillance, among other things. As a result of these violations, the SIC noted that EDIFICIO ESTUDIO was initially issued a fine of COP 10,892,400 (approx. â‚¬2,470) for its violations, and ordered to take certain administrative actions.
Following this, the SIC detailed that other resolutions were issued in which EDIFICIO ESTUDIOhad an opportunity to present evidence with respect to the right to defence. The SIC specified that the evidentiary and preliminary reviews of the case resulted in a question of a lack of proportionality and reasonableness with respect to the initially imposed penalty, and a need to reassess the application of the principle of accountability with respect to the violations and penalty.
Findings of the SIC
As such, the SIC found that the violations of EDIFICIO ESTUDIO not only endangered the rights of data subjects, but also violated the right of 
Outcomes
As a result of the assessment of the initial measures taken against EDIFICIO ESTUDIO, the SIC issued a fine of COP 2,723,100 (approx. â‚¬620) and did not grant the possibility for appeal, reaffirmingÂ previous orders for EDIFICIO ESTUDIO to ensure that it has the various policies in place required for the processing of personal data.

In particular, the SIC noted thatÂ a citizen complained as some of their personal data provided to EPS was modified by EPS, causing damage to the citizen. Moreover, the SIC notedÂ that during the administrative action, the modification of the data subject'sÂ affiliation form was verified, changing the municipality of residence (BogotÃ¡) to a different one (Tabio) to which the data subject had initially reported. Futhermore, the SIC highlighted that all of the above happened without the authorisation of the data subject.
In addition, the data subject had to submit several requests to EPS for them to correct their information and EPS took more than 10 months to correct the person's data, when the maximum term to rectify information was 15 business days. Finally, the SIC emphasised that it cannot become a business practice for the dataÂ subject to have to insist several times for their rights to be guaranteed;Â aÂ single request should be sufficient, and it is up to the data controllerÂ to enforce the rights of data subjectsÂ within the maximum legal deadlines established.

'''The Colombian data protection authority ('SIC') published, on 14 April 2021, Resolution No. 20165 of 2021, in which it fined Habitamos Propiedad Raiz S.A.S.

Background to the case
During the course of an inspection by the SIC to Habitamos' office, the SIC proceeded to interview the accountant and head of human resources of Habitamos who described their operations, which are focused on real estate leasing and brokerage services.
The accountant noted that, depending on the service required from the company (appraisal, mortgage, sale, or lease of real estate), the client must fill out a form depending on the case, together with the insurer's form,Â in order to carry out the credit checks and obtain authorisation. The accountant added thatÂ said form is requested for the processing of personal data, either in the body of the document or as an annexed document, such as in the case of the consignment contract, mortgage loan study, and the administration contract.
However, from the SIC's inspection, it was evident that even though the form provided for the consignment of the properties by the clients to the real estate agencyÂ for the collection of their personal data, the formÂ didÂ not meetÂ the notion of legitimate purpose in accordance with the Data Protection Law. Moreover, the SIC notedÂ that the data collectionÂ must be adequate to achieve the intended purpose, which within the forms provided to obtain the authorisation for the processing of personal data from the data subject was not evident.
Findings of the SIC
The SIC found that Habitamos had not informed the data subjects about the purpose of the data collection and their rights to grant consent. The SIC further outlined that Habitamos did not have aÂ mechanism to allow the information managed by them to be keptÂ under secure conditions necessary to prevent their unauthorised or fraudulent loss, use, or access.

The SIC imposed a fine of COP 7,515,756 (approx. â‚¬1,700),Â and noted that the payment must be made within five working days, following the publication of the resolution.

In particular, and following the SIC being aware of alleged violations by the company, it had sent the company an information request, requesting the company to provide information on reasons for not registering in the National Registry of Databases as required by law, to provide a copy of their data processing policy, security policy, and procedures manual with respect to claims and inquiries, as well as the manual for procedures around the processing of personal data and to indicate the mechanisms or sources through which the company collects personal data.
Following this initial request by the SIC, the company failed to provide the requested information within the legally prescribed period of five days.

In particular, SIC found thatÂ L&F Consultorias Legales y Financieras had offered its services to individuals whose personal data it had gathered by cross-referencing information published in aÂ newspaper with the websites of the Civil Register and Attorney General. SIC noted that though L&F ConsultoriasÂ Legales y Financieras had alleged these wereÂ publicly available sources, information gathered fromÂ mass media sources such as newspapers or the internet doÂ not, 'under any circumstances,'Â constitute public sources. SIC therefore statedÂ that L&F Consultorias Legales y Financieras should have gained theÂ prior andÂ expressÂ consent of data subjectsÂ before processing their data, as well asÂ informingÂ them of the purposes for which their data was collected.Â 
SIC also found deficiencies regardingÂ L&F Consultorias Legales y Financieras' privacy policies. SIC noted thatÂ although the companyÂ had implemented internal policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Law, as well as an adequate processingÂ policy, these were not available for consultation by data subjects at the time they were contacted. SIC therefore orderedÂ L&F Consultorias Legales y Financieras to implement aÂ supervision and periodic review plan in order to ensure effective compliance with the Law;Â publish a privacy notice through whichever medium the company deems appropriate in cases in which it is not possible to make their processing policies available to data subjects; andÂ document and implement a procedure to collect data subjects' consent in order toÂ market to them.

Background to the case
In particular, according to the SIC, after a complaint made by aÂ data subject and the subsequent investigation by the SIC, numerous irregularities were found.

'''The Colombian data protection authority ('SIC') published, on 14 March 2018, threeÂ decisions taken fromÂ 19 to 27Â FebruaryÂ 2018Â regardingÂ Casa Editorial El Tiempo S.A., Universidad Manuela Beltran ('UMB'), andÂ Falabella de Colombia S.A.'sÂ noncompliance withÂ data subjects' requestsÂ to access and delete their personal information, in violation of Statutory Law 1581 of 2012 (October 17) which Issues General Provisions for the Protection of Personal Data.Â 
In its firstÂ decision,Â SIC found that El Tiempo had failed to comply withÂ a data subject's request for his data to be eliminatedÂ from its database so he no longer receivedÂ email marketing. SIC notedÂ that although El Tiempo had responded to the data subject's request and informed him that his data would be eliminated within 10 days, this had not occurred and that theÂ data subject had continued to receive direct marketing. El Tiempo alleged that a human error had led to the data not being deleted and that it had been rectified once it became aware of the mistake. However, SIC stated that El Tiempo's failure to adequately comply with the requestÂ wasÂ a violation of the data subject's right to 
In the second decision, SIC finedÂ UMBÂ COP 7,812,420Â (approx. â‚¬2,230)Â for failing to respond to a subject access request regarding information on the data subject's personal data contained in UMB's database within the established deadline, since it took over 11 months to comply. The data subject had also requested information on UMB'sÂ internal data protectionÂ manual and procedure, which SIC found complied with the legal requirements.Â 
Finally, FalabellaÂ was fined COP 195,310,500 (approx. â‚¬55,700) for failing to adequatelyÂ respondÂ to a data subject's request to have their data deleted from its database within theÂ stipulated timeframe and for failing to comply with the request. Although Falabella stated that it had complied with the request, the data subject received email marketing to a second email address and SIC held that this was a violation of Falabella's obligation to implement sufficient mechanisms to ensure that all the data subject's information was deleted from its database.Â SIC highlighted that the fine was a result of Falabella'sÂ recurringÂ violations, since it was fined COP 137,891,00 (approx. â‚¬39,320) for similar violations in 2016.Â

Findings of the SIC
During its investigation, the SIC found that SystemGroup did not provide documentary evidence with which it can be determined that SystemGroup was merely acting to collect personal data, and instead was found to be a source of personal data, contrary to its obligations in contract, thereby violating Article 8(1) of the Law.
In addition, the SIC highlighted the failure of SystemGroup in its reports to comply with the duty of truthfulness regarding the name of the source of personal data and the name of the originating creditor of the reported obligations, which was BancoDavivienda in the circumstances. Accordingly, the SIC found SystemGroup to be in violation of Article 8(10) of the Law.
Furthermore, the SIC noted the source of personal data must be able to demonstrate that the owner previously consented to the processing of their financial information. However, the SIC provided that in the circumstances, SystemGroup submitted a copy of a credit application which contained the prior consent signed by the owner, but that it was not possible to determine that it corresponded to the contracted obligations with BancoDavivienda, thereby violating the requirement to obtain informed consent under Article 8(5) of the Law.

In addition, the AG highlighted that when SEMA was the target of a phishing attack in October 2018, the company did not have a data disposal policy. Moreover, the AG outlined that SEMA employees had stored personal information, such as social security numbers, bank account or routing numbers, and driver's license numbers, in their employee email accounts for as long as 20 years. Additionally, SEMA is alleged to have failed to account for this risky practice and did not take a comprehensive approach to information security, as it should have, given its size and the nature of the information it maintained.

'''The Personal Data Protection Agency ('AZOP') published, on 8 March 2022, its decision in which it imposed a fine of HRK 940,000 (approx. â‚¬124,000) against an unnamed energy sector company for violations of Articles 15(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), for failure to submit video surveillance recordings at the request of the data subject.
Background to the decision
In particular, AZOP initiated its investigation following a claim filed by the complainant who requested the company to submit video surveillance camera footage of the complainant, specifying the date and time. Moreover, the decision notes that the complainant used the services of a petrol station at one of the company's branches, however due to dissatisfaction, filed a complaint in accordance with consumer protection regulations.
Nonetheless, the decision highlights that the company rejected the request as it considered that there was no written request from the competent authorities to provide a copy of the recording, that the purpose of the request was not justified, and that obtaining such a copy would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of petrol station employees and customers. In addition, the decision emphasises that, at the prior request of the complainant, the AZOP gave a general opinion on the obligation of the data controller to provide copies of the requested video surveillance footage, however, the company noted that it could no longer provide the requested recordings since the footage is deleted after seven days.
Findings of the AZOP
Further to this, AZOP found that the company violated the right to access personal dataÂ by denying the individual the right to obtain a copy of the CCTV footage.
In conclusion, AZOP took into account the indirect material damaged to the complaint, including that the company indirectly avoided potential financial damage it could suffer due to the dispute with the complaint, and by not submitting a recording it eliminated, which could potentially beÂ important evidence in a special proceeding.
Outcomes
Based on these findings, AZOP deemed it appropriate to impose the company with the aforementioned fine for violation of Article 15(3) of the GDPR.

'''The Personal Data Protection Agency ('AZOP') published, on 8 March 2022, its decision in which it imposed a fine of HRK 675,000 (approx. â‚¬89,000) against an unnamed retail chain company for violations of Articles 32(1)(b), 32(1)(d), 32(2), and 32(4) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), for failure to take appropriate security measures for the processing of personal data, which led to the unauthorised processing of personal data of the complainants through their publication on social networks and in the media.
Background to the decision
In particular, AZOP noted that it received a report on alledged violations of personal data from the company, stating that the employees of the company, without authorisationÂ and contrary to internal acts and instructions, recorded video surveillance footage with their mobile devices and published it on social networks and in the media.
Findings of the AZOP
Further to this, AZOP found that the company did not take adequate actions to prevent its employees from taking video surveillance images using their mobile devices. Moreover, the decision provides that the company took certain organisational measures, such as employee education and adoption of internal acts, but did not take appropriate technical security measures that could reduce the risk of a similar violation, neither before nor after the incident.
In addition, the decision highlights that the company did not regularly monitor the implementation of technical and organisational measures aimed at ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data, and failed to regularly test, evaluate, and determine the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of video surveillance. Therefore, the decision confirms that the company failed to implement appropriate technical security measures for personal data processing.
In conclusion, AZOP considered that the corrective measures in the form of administrative fines are effective, proportionate, and dissuasive and that the aforementioned amount is fully appropriate to the circumstances took in this case.
Outcomes
Based on these findings, AZOP deemed it appropriate to impose the company with the aforementioned fine for violation of Articles 32(1)(b), 32(1)(d), 32(2), and 32(4) of the GDPR.

Background to the decision
In particular, the AZOP explained that the telecommunications service provider had notified both the AZOP and the users of a security incidentÂ affecting approximately 100,000 data subjects.
Findings of the AZOP
Further to the above, the AZOP found that the telecommunications service provider had implemented insufficient technical and organisational measures, failing to ensure an adequate level of security of the personal data processed. In particular, the AZOP outlined that the telecommunications service provider was responsible for multiple omissions during the design of the processing system, including in relation to limiting access, the inclusion of appropriate corrective actions in the system, and the execution of the prescribed organisational measures contained in the existing internal policies. As such, the AZOP determined that the telecommunications service provider had breached its obligations under Articles 25(1), 32(1)(b), 32(1)(d), and 32(2) of the GDPR.
In light of the established facts, the AZOP imposed an administrative fine. In determining its amount, the AZOPÂ took into account, as an aggravating factor, the fact that the data controller is one of the leading companies providing telecommunications services in Croatia, and thus, given the large volume of personal data processed, it was expected to implement more complex organisational and technical measures.

Background to the decision

Additionally, the Commissioner found the actions to be in breach of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1), 13(1) and (2), and 21(4) of theÂ GDPR and that the disclosure was unlawful, however, when considering a sanction for Pancyprian Insurance, the Commissioner omitted to issue a fine on the breaches given that the circumstances of the breach were not severe and do not justify a fine on the complaint made, instead the Commissioner issued a publicÂ reprimand on the breaches.

'''The Danish data protection authority ('Datatilsynet')Â published, onÂ 18Â OctoberÂ 2022, its decision in Case No.Â 2020-431-0075,Â issued on 30 September 2022,Â in whichÂ it had expressed criticism againstÂ SmartResponse A/S, for violations of Articles 5(1)(e), 6, 12(1),Â 13 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following an investigation of the SmartResponse'sÂ data processing practices.Â 
Background to the decision
In particular, the Datatilsynet stated that its investigation had focused onÂ the SmartResponse'sÂ disclosure of personal data in connection with offering online competitions and questionnaires. In this regard, theÂ Datatilsynet noted that such competitions required participants to consent to the processing of their personal data andÂ to passing on theirÂ data to the SmartResponse'sÂ business partners. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that competition participants were asked to fill in questionnairesÂ aimed at tailoring marketing content to individuals, information which was then passed to the SmartResponse'sÂ business partners on the basis of Article 13(2) of the Danish Data Protection Act No. 502 of 23 May 2018 ('the Act').
Additionally, the Datatilsynet specified that SmartResponse, upon withdrawal of consent by aÂ participant, had registered the participant'sÂ number and email on a 'no-thanks list', andÂ stated that SmartResponse'sÂ storage period for the information was fiveÂ years in accordance with the statute of limitations in the Act. Moreover, the Datatilsynet noted that with regard to the obligation to provide information,Â SmartResponseÂ had directed participants to its personal data policy via a link that appeared in the competition.
Findings of the Datatilsynet
Notably, theÂ Datatilsynet found that the consent obtained by SmartResponse for participation in competitionsÂ wasÂ in accordanceÂ with the GDPR. However, the Datatilsynet found thatÂ the legal basis of legitimate interestÂ underÂ Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR was inadequate for the processing of personal data of those responding to the questionnaires. In fact, the Datatilsynet took the view that, due to the complexity of the dataÂ processed,Â such data processing required consent.Â 
Moreover, the Datatilsynet foundÂ that SmartResponse'sÂ no-thanks list amounted toÂ unnecessary processing of personal data,Â contrary toÂ the principle of data minimisation and the legitimate interestÂ rule.
Furthermore, in connection with SmartResponse'sÂ storage of personal data for demonstrating validity of obtained consent, the Datatilsynet noted that suchÂ storage is permittedÂ only while the processing is ongoing, and thus foundÂ Smart ResponseÂ in breach of Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR.
Lastly, the Datatilsynet found that participants had not recievedÂ sufficient information about SmartResponse processing of their personal data in breach of Article 12(1) and 13 of the GDPR, since participantsÂ were not informedÂ of theÂ continued storage of personal data after consent was withdrawn.
Outcomes
Ultimately, the Datatilsynet found SmartResponseÂ in breach of the above mentioned articles of the GDPR and ordered the sameÂ to delete personal data which appears on its internal no-thanks list which does not require further storage.Â

'''The Danish data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') announced, on 16 September 2021, that it had reported the Favrskov Municipality to the police for failing to implement sufficient technical security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of data subject's personal dataÂ and had recommended a fine of DKK 75,000 (approx. â‚¬10,000) for the same. In particular, the Datatilsynet noted that the decision relates to a personal data breach report from the Municipality that stated a laptop had been stolen, containing a program with the personal data of about 100 people with reduced physical and/or mental capacity. More specifically, the report states that the laptop's hard drive had not been encrypted and that the program containing personal data had not been equipped with security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of the data and prevent unauthorised access to it, in contravention of Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').

Further to the above, the AG took the view that Articles 88(1) and 88(2) of the GDPR are to be interpreted as meaning that a legislative provision adopted by a Member State is a more specific rule for ensuring the protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees' personal data in the employment context only if it meets the requirements laid down by Article 88(2) of the GDPR. Conversely, the AG continued thatÂ if the legislative provision under Member States law does not meet the requirements laid down by Article 88(2) of the GDPR, it is applicable, where appropriate, only in so far as it may be based on other provisions of the GDPR or on national adaptation provisions, as referred to in Article 6(2) of the GDPR.

'''The Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU') issued, on 22 June 2021, its decision in C-439/19 onÂ whether the Latvian Law on Road Traffic of 1 October 1997 ('the Road Traffic Law') is compatible with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the CJEU noted that the Road Traffic Law requires the Latvian Road Traffic Safety Directorate ('CSDD') to maintain a public register containing data relating to the penalty points imposed on drivers for road traffic offences. More specifically, the CSDD may disclose such information to any person who so requests, without the need to establish a specific interest in obtaining that information, regardless of commercial or non-commercial motivation.
In this regard, the CJEU observed that information relating to penalty points does constitute personal data and that activities relating to road safety cannot be classified as having the aim of safeguarding national security. As such, the CJEU concluded that the processing carried out by the CSDD falls within the scope of the GDPR. Therefore, the CJEU found that the GDPR precludes the Road Traffic Law, noting that the disclosure of such dataÂ is not necessary. Lastly, while the CJEU acknowledged that the improvement of road safety is considered as in the public interest, the CJEU highlighted that there are less intrusive means to do so and that, in the light of the sensitivity of such data, the rights of data subjects prevail over public interest and the right to freedom of information.

Furthermore, the CJEU recalled that consent under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') is not validly given in the case of silence, pre-ticked boxes, or inactivity, as well as that, if the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, that declaration must be presented in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.

'''The Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU') issued, on 20 September 2022, the Advocate General's Opinion C-252/21 | Meta Platforms Inc., and Others (General terms of use of a social network). In particular, the CJEU highlighted that users of Meta must accept Facebook's terms of service ('ToS'), which refer to Meta's data and cookie policies, and under which Meta also collects data from other Meta platforms such as Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as third-party websites and applications. In addition, the CJEU outlined that the German Federal Competition Authority ('Bundeskartellamt') had previously prohibited Meta from processing data in accordance with such terms, finding that the processing did not comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and was an abuse of Meta's dominant market position.
Following Meta's appeal to the Higher Regional Court of DÃ¼sseldorf, the CJEU outlined that while a competition authority does not have jurisdiction to rule on an infringement of the GDPR, it may take into account the compatibility of a commercial practice with the GDPR. More specifically, the CJEU noted that compliance or non-compliance of conduct with the provisions of the GDPR, in the circumstances, is an important indication of whether that conduct amounts to a breach of competition rules. Nonetheless, the CJEU conceded that a competition authority can only assess compliance with the GDPR as an incidental question, without prejudice to the powers of the competent supervisory authority, and must take account of any decision or investigation by the relevant supervisory authority.
Furthermore, the CJEU noted that the mere fact that a social network enjoys a dominant market position does not call into question the validity of the consent of the userÂ regarding the processing of personal data, though such a position may play a role in assessing the freedom of consent. Finally, the CJEU detailed, with regard to the prohibition on the processing of sensitive personal data, that in order for the prohibition to be exempted, the user must be made fully aware that they are making their personal data public.

Background to the case

AG's opinion
In response to BGH's question, the AG proposed that the BGH interprets the GDPR as meaning that it does not preclude national legislation which allows consumer protection associations to bring legal proceedings against the person alleged to be responsible for an infringement of the protection of personal data, provided that the objective of the representative action in question is to ensure the observance of the rights, which the persons affected by the contested processing derive directly from that regulation.
Additionally, the AG stated that, in his view, the Member States may still provide for the possibility for certain entities to bring â€“ without a mandate from the data subjects and without there being a need to claim the existence of actual cases affecting named individuals â€“ representative actions designed to protect the collective interests of consumers, provided that an infringement of the provisions of that regulation, which are intended to confer subjective rights on data subjects, is alleged.

In particular, JourovÃ¡ highlighted, ""The GDPR gave powers to EU data protection authorities to enforce [the] GDPR and sanction the violations. One year on, the newly established governance structure with the European Data Protection Board has registered more than 470 cross-border cases around Europe and is working well together to solve them. The fears that they will become sanctioning machines have not materialised. On the contrary, they see themselves as partners for dialogue with business and other stakeholders.""
In addition, JourovÃ¡ noted, ""We see more and more links between data management and companies' finances. [â€¦] To a large extent, our experience with the application of the GDPR is that it has showed what data protection is really about - that is, 'simply'Â sound data management.""
Moreover, JourovÃ¡ added, ""[W]e are pursuing further adequacy talks with third countries. Some seem to be reaching maturity in this regard. For instance, talks with South Korea are at an advanced stage.Â While we continue those efforts, we can now take full advantage of the additional tools provided under the GDPR to enable international data transfers based on strong and enforceable safeguards: from standard contractual clauses to certification and codes of conduct.""
Furthermore,Â the CommissionÂ issued, on 13 June 2019,Â the results of a Eurobarometer survey on data protection which looked at the views of 27,000 EU citizens. In particular, the Commission highlighted that 67% of the respondents knew about the GDPR and that 57% knew about their national data protection authorities. The Commission also noted that 73% of respondents had heard of at least one of the six tested rights guaranteed by the GDPR, with 65% being aware of their right of access. In addition, the Commission outlined that, as of 13 June 2019, it had launched its awareness campaign to encourage citizens to read privacy statements and to optimise their privacy settings so that they only share the data they are willing to share.

JourovÃ¡Â noted that the rules for entering into contracts or other legal acts are to be found in EU and/or national legislation rather than in the GDPR.Â 
JourovÃ¡ further stated, 'The e-commerce Directive (Directive 2000/31/EC) provides for the removal of legal obstacles to the use of electronic contracts. It does not harmonise the form electronic contracts can take. In principle, automated contract processes are lawful. It is not necessary to append an electronic signature to contracts for them to have legal effects. E-signatures are one of several means to prove their conclusion and terms.

The Guidance highlights the preparatory work undertaken so far at a EU level, including what has been done by the Article 29 Working Party ('WP29') and outlinesÂ that the WP29 is also working on the updating of its opinions including the tools for transferring data to non-EU countries. In addition, it addresses the next steps and challenges.

Further, the Commission stated, 'When adapting their national legislation, Member States have to take into account the fact that any national measures which would have the result of creating an obstacle to the direct applicability of the GDPR and of jeopardising its simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the EU are contrary to the Treaties. Repeating the text of regulations in national law is also prohibited (e.g. repeating definitions or the rights of individuals), unless such repetitions are strictly necessary for the sake of coherence and in order to make national laws comprehensible to those to whom they apply.'

In addition, the Guidelines highlight the application of criteria for theÂ establishment of data controllers and processors and the application of criteria for targeting in the absence of an establishment in the Union, as well as the role of a representative of controllers or processors without an establishment in the EU. Moreover,Â theÂ Guidelines outlineÂ that in the absence of an establishment in the Union, a controller or processor cannot benefit from the one-stop shop mechanism provided for in Article 56 of the GDPR becauseÂ the cooperation and consistency mechanism of the GDPR only applies to controllers and processors with an establishment, or establishments, within the EU. Furthermore, the Guidelines note that data controllers or processors subject to the GDPR in accordance with Article 3(2) are under the obligation to designate an EU representative.

'''The European Data Protection Board ('EDPB') adopted, on 23 January 2019, Opinion 3/2019Â ('the Opinion') concerning the Questions and Answers on the interplay between the Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 536/2014) ('CTR')Â and the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Opinion distinguishes twoÂ main categories of processing operationsÂ during theÂ lifecycle of a clinical trial, which fall under different legal bases,Â namelyÂ operations purely related to research activities,Â and operations related to the purposes of protection of health. In this regard, the EDPB notedÂ that the appropriate lawful bases for processing operations related to research activities would be either the data subject'sÂ explicit consent or a task carried out in the public interest, whilst forÂ processing operations related to the purposes ofÂ protection of health, the lawful basis would be the necessity of theÂ controller to comply with aÂ legal obligation.Â 
In addition, the Opinion notes that the presumption of compatibility as provided under Article 5(1)(b) of the GDPR should not be excluded, in all circumstances, for the secondary use of clinical trial data outside the clinical trial protocol for other scientific purposes. Finally, the OpinionÂ provides thatÂ even when the presumption of compatibility will apply, the scientific research making use of the data outside the protocol of the clinical trial must be conducted in compliance with all other relevant applicable provisions of data protection, as stated under Article 28(2) of the CTR.

'''The European Data Protection Board ('EDPB') issued, on 28 August 2020, two letters in response to questions of members of the European Parliaments ('MEPs') Birgit Sippel and Moritz KÃ¶rner, in relation to, respectively, the enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') against public authorities and the use of Microsoft 365, Facebook, and Instagram on school computers.
In particular, the EDPB, in relation to the enforcement of the GDPR against public authorities, outlined that the enforcement of the GDPR lies within the competence of the national supervisory authorities, and that it cannot carry out any enforcement activities against public authorities in Member States. On the same, the EDPBÂ notedÂ that, in accordance with the Article 70 of the GDPR, it has established an enforcement expert subgroup, where representatives of the national supervisory authorities exchange regularly information on matters of the enforcement of the GDPR in Member States. In addition, the EDPB recalled that Article 83(7) of the GDPR contains an opening clause which allows Member States to lay down rules in national laws on whether and to what extent administrative fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies, and thatÂ some Member States excluded the possibility to impose fines on public authorities and bodies in their national legislations.
Moreover, and in relation to the use of Microsoft 365, Facebook, and Instagram on school computers, the EDPB noted that information on the matter has been forwarded to the national supervisory authorities for their consideration, and that it encourages controllers in the public and private sector to carefully assess the risks arising from their processing activities and ensure compliance with the principles and obligations set out by the GDPR, including in terms of legal basis for processing and international transfers, especially when the processing of personal data relating to vulnerable data subjects is at stake.

In particular, the EDPB's response covers the legal basis for processing health data for scientific research, the further processing of previously collected health data, the notion of broad consent, transparency of data processing, anonymisation, pseudonymisation and safeguards, as well as general questions on the processing of special categories of data on a large scale. More specifically, with regards to legal bases for health research, the EDPB noted that when conducting a health research project in the multiple Member States, it is recommended to use the same legal basis for processing data associated with the project, whenever that is possible. In addition, the EDPB highlighted that, when the further processing of pre-collected health data relies on the presumption of compatible use, under Article 5(1)(b) of the GDPR, it is possible that unlike the processing initially conducted by the healthcare provider, the further processing of health data for scientific purposes cannot fall under the same exemptions to the sensitive data processing prohibition under Article 9 of the GDPR. Lastly, in connection to anonymisation and safeguards, the EDPB highlighted that the possibility of anonymising genetic data remains an unsolved issue.

In particular, the study notes that appropriate safeguards in this context refer to the relevant technical and organisational measures adopted by controllers and processors to protect the data subject's rights and freedoms while conducting scientific research and that to this extent, special relevance is given to those measures aimed at ensuring respect for the principle of data minimisation. Furthermore, the study notes that although scientific research as a legal concept is not determined, this study, however, contemplates it from a broad perspective, which includes, among other things, technological development and demonstration as well as fundamental and applied research conducted both by public and private institutions. Moreover, the study highlights that the results of the study show that certain harmonisation exists among EEA States with respect to appropriate safeguards for scientific research, as required by the GDPR. However, the study notes that a conundrum of various bodies of law and (ethical) guidelines regulate scientific research in specific areas, such as biobanking, health, epidemiology, social benefits, artificial intelligence, and statistics and as a result the legal framework for sectoral research remains fragmented.

'''The European Data Protection Board ('EDPB') published, on 19 November 2021, its Guidelines 05/2021 on the Interplay between the application of Article 3 and the provisions on international transfers as per Chapter V of the GDPR, as adopted on 18 November 2021. In particular, the guidelines aim to clarify the interplay between Article 3 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and the provisions of the GDPR on international transfers in Chapter V in order to assist controllers and processors in the EU in identifying whether dataÂ processing constitutes a transfer to a third country or to an international organisation and, as a result, whether they have to comply with the provisions of Chapter V of the GDPR.Â 
More specifically, the guidelines identifyÂ the three following cumulative criteria that qualify dataÂ processing as a transfer:
The guidelines provide further guidance on each of these criteria with supplementary examples of specific processing situations which the EDPB has considered. For example,Â the examples providedÂ clarify that the second criterion listed above is neitherÂ fulfilled in cases where the controller in a third country collects data directly from a data subject in the EU, nor in cases of remote access of personal data in aÂ third country by an employee of the controller.
In addition, the guidelines outline that, if all of the criteria are met, there is a 'transfer to a third country or to an international organisation', and the controller or processor in the given processing situation will therefore be requiredÂ to comply with the conditions of Chapter V and frame the transfer by using the instruments provided in Chapter V, which aim at protecting personal data after they have been transferred to a third country or an international organisation.Â 
Furthemore, the guidelines note that such instruments include the existence ofÂ an adequate level of protection in the third country or international organisation to which the data is transferred, orÂ in the absence of such adequate level of protection, the implementation by the exporterÂ of appropriate safeguards as provided for in Article 46 of the GDPR. Further to this point, the guidelines highlight that theÂ content of the Article 46 safeguards needs to be customised depending on the situation, noting for example the modular approach in the Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs') adopted by the European Commission in June 2021. Accordingly, the guidelines provide that when developing transfer tools such as SCCs,Â the Article 3(2) situation should be taken into account in order not to duplicate the GDPR obligations but rather to address the elements and principles that are missingÂ and, thus, needed to fill the gaps relating to conflicting national laws and government access in the third country, as well as the difficulty to enforce and obtain redress against an entity outside the EU.
Further to the above, the guidelines encourage theÂ development of a transfer tool, such as a new set of SCCs, in cases where the importer is subject to the GDPR for the given processing in accordance with Article 3(2).

In particular, the Paper recommends that the roles and responsibilities of processors and sub-processors should be clearly stipulated and monitored to ensure minimal risk to individual privacy, as well as noting that in the Inter-Institutional License Agreement ('ILA') between the EU Institutions and Microsoft, the purpose behind Microsoft's processing was not sufficiently specific. In addition, the Paper notes that the provisions of the ILA, including the granting to Microsoft of a right to unilaterally amend the terms, and the lack of defined purposes for processing resulted in Microsoft acting as a data controller. Moreover, the Paper notes that in cases where public organisations procure services from a contractor, such contractor is granted discretion to act as controller, thereby posing a risk for the public interest mandate of the organisation, and that, in light of this, public authorities should assess whether it is appropriate that a contractor becomes a controller in respect of staff and citizen personal data. Lastly, the Paper gives recommendations on, among other things, drafting a comprehensive controller-processor agreement, including the need to define the nature of processing, the categories of concerned data subjects, and the duration of processing.

'''Â The European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA') published, on 24 March 2022, its decision in case no. ESMA41-356-271, as issued on 22 March 2022, in which it ordered a fine of â‚¬186,000 to trade repository REGIS-TR S.A., for violations of eight breaches with respect to Point (c) of Section II of Annex I and Point (b) of Section III of Annex I of the Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories (European Market Infrastructure Regulation) ('EMIR'), following an investigation into the same.
Background to the decision
In particular, the ESMA noted that the breaches relate to failures in ensuring the integrity of data and providing direct and immediate access to regulators. In addition, ESMA stated that the breaches were committed between 2017 and 2020, noting that five out of eight breaches were found to have resulted from negligence on the part of REGIS-TR.
Findings of ESMA
In particular, ESMA found that REGIS-TR negligently failed to ensure the integrity of the data reported to it due to various data processing incidents, including not having ensured the integrity of the data reported to REGIS-TR and having incorrectly rejected data correctly reported by the reporting parties. Furthermore, ESMA noted that REGIS-TR negligently failed to provide direct and immediate access to regulators by generating incorrect reports, failing to provide reports within the specified time limits, and omitting data in the reports due to wrong rejections. Moreover, ESMA found that REGIS-TR committed three further breaches resulting in the provision of wrong and unreliable reports to regulators by failing to verify the correctness and completeness of the data received by the reporting parties.
Outcomes
In light of the above, ESMA fined REGIS-TR â‚¬186,000 for breaches of the EMIR and adopted supervisory measures in the form of a public notice ESMA41-356-274 to be issued in respect of each of infringements. Furthermore, ESMA stated that REGIS-TR may appeal against this decision to the Board of Appeal of the European Supervisory Authorities ('the Board of Appeal'). However, ESMA noted that such an appeal does not have suspensive effect, although it is possible for the Board of Appeal to suspend the application of the decision in accordance with Article 60(3) of the Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority).

In addition, the blog post notes that it is exactly because the GDPR was accompanied by the highest ambitions and hopes that the EU should not turn a blind eye to its current shortcomings and that the GDPR granted data protection authorities with the competence to curb unlawful data power, and to bring it within the ambit of the rule of law, and that unfortunately, very little of either of these things, for now, has been seen.

'''The GDPR introduced a possibility for controllers and processors to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR through adherence to an approved code of conduct. The code should be prepared by an association or other body representing categories of controllers or processors with the purpose of specifying the application of the GDPR in a specific sector, such as with regard to fair and transparent processing, the collection of personal data, and the information provided to the public and to data subjects. In order for the code to be a legitimate tool that contributes to the proper application of the GDPR, it must be submitted to, and approved by, a competent supervisory authority. Transnational codes should, before approval, also be subject to the European Data Protection Board's ('EDPB') opinion.
Following the implementation of the GDPR, many associations prepared codes of conduct, both on national and transnational levels. However, we had to wait until this year, before the first transnational codes of conduct were approved; the 'EU Data Protection Code of Conduct for Cloud Service Providers' ('the EU Cloud Code') â€“ submitted to the Belgian Data Protection Authority by Scope Europe (with members like Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Salesforce) â€“ and the code of conduct of Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe ('the CISPE Code') â€“ submitted to the French data protection authority by the Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers (with members like Amazon Web Services) (together, 'the Codes'). The reasons may be many; it is expensive to draw up a code of conduct that meets the GDPR's criteria, while it is also expensive and requires a robust organisation to ensure that the code is properly managed. Initially, the supervisory authorities also urged stakeholders to wait for the EDPB's guidelines on Codes of conduct and monitoring bodies â€“ which were adopted in its final wording in June 2019.
Before the Codes in question were formally approved, the EDPB adopted its opinions on the same. In its opinions, the EDPB gave the green light to the Codes and they were approved shortly thereafter (in May and June, respectively).
The EU Cloud Code and the CISPE Code both address cloud computing â€“ which is interesting enough since it is an area currently suffering from a lot of scrutiny following the decision in 
IaaS can be seen as a 'first step' to adopt for the use of cloud services. It enables an organisation to shift from the use of on-premise hardware (i.e. servers) for storage to a cloud-based hosting service. The latter will be tailored and scalable to the organisation's requirements. PaaS adds an additional layer of 'platform software' to the IaaS, providing organisations with a ready-to-go software environment, e.g. for development or hosting of proprietary web-based software. SaaS, as the final add on, ensures that the organisation can also access software and application services via the internet.
While the cloud service providers' security standards may be high and their resources to tackle data security threats are better than if kept within the organisation's internal IT department, using cloud services still requires the organisation to entrust the service provider with data and information to a certain degree. The GDPR requires that a controller (i.e
While the CISPE Code applies to the specific features of processing by IaaS providers, the EU Cloud Code addresses all service types of the cloud market (e.g. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and creates a 'baseline for implementation of GDPR' for these services. However, the main objective of the Codes is to concretise the legal requirements of Article 28 of the GDPR and the relevant related articles of the GDPR (i.e. to ensure that the cloud service provider provides sufficient in such a manner that processing will meet the GDPR's requirements and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject). In its opinions, the EDPB specifically recalled that the Codes will not apply to all the processing operations carried out on behalf of the controller, but only to the elements of Article 28 and related relevant articles.
In light of the Schrems II decision and its aftermath, it should specifically be noted that neither code is meant for international transfers of personal data and therefore does not provide appropriate safeguards within the framework of transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations. Consequently, any transfer of personal data to a third country or to an international organisation may take place only if the provisions of Chapter V are respected. This includes the need to carry out a Data Transfer Impact Assessment, if the transfer relies on one of the Article 46 transfer tools.
The EDPB concluded the Codes facilitate the effective application of the GDPR and contain both strict requirements particularising provisions of the GDPR and good practices currently followed by the sector. The Codes also describe the rights and obligations of adhering services providers on key principles of GDPR such as purpose limitations, data subject rights, transfers, security, auditing, liability, etc.
In terms of 'added value', the EDPB found that the Codes provide guidance adapted to the sector on security measures, auditing requirements, data subject rights, and transparency requirements, to mention a few.
In addition, the Codes also contain mechanisms that enable a monitoring body accredited by the EDPB to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compliance with them and ensure that efficient enforcement measures are put in place to ensure compliance. These mechanisms consist of three phases: (i) one that binds the actor that wants to adhere to the code and enables the monitoring body to assess the actor's eligibility, (ii) one that describes how the monitoring of compliance with the code takes place on an ongoing basis, and (iii) how such monitoring is to be carried out 
Scope of application: Both the CISPE Code and the EU Cloud Code enable cloud service providers to understand and comply with the GDPR principles applicable to them as data processors.
Outside the scope of application: Neither the CISPE Code nor the EU Cloud Code apply to the processing of personal data in an actor's capacity as data controller. Nor do they apply in business to consumer relationships. However, consumers may still benefit from knowing that their personal data has been entrusted to a company that uses a processor that adheres to any of the codes.
Moreover, neither code can be used as a transfer mechanism to validate international transfers of personal data under the GDPR.

'''The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights ('FRA')Â published, on 30 April 2021, Opinion 1/2021 onÂ Equality in the EU 20 years on from the initial implementation of the equality directives. In particular, the opinion aims toÂ illustrate the extent and nature of lived experiences of inequality and discrimination across the EU, with reference to the grounds of discrimination and areas of life covered by the racial and employment equality directives, as well as in relation to the grounds and areas covered by the proposed Equal Treatment Directive.
Furthermore, the opinion highlights that theÂ absence of robust and systematically collected equality dataÂ paints an incomplete picture of the reality of discrimination in the EU, and therefore recommends thatÂ EU Member States ensure the systematic collection of reliable, valid, and comparable equality data, disaggregated by sex, racialÂ and ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, in order to appropriately ground anti-discrimination policies. In this regard, the opinion emphasises that all equality data collection and processing should be done in full compliance with the principles and safeguards set out under the GDPR, whilst outlining thatÂ Member States can collect and process equality data based on special categories of personal data for reasons of substantial public interest, statistical purposes and scientificÂ or historical research purposes by ensuring that the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes.
The opinion further recalls Recital 26 of the GDPR, highlightingÂ thatÂ the principles of data protection should not apply to anonymous information or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable, such as data used for aggregate statistical purposes to identify and record trends in equality.

'''The Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe ('IAB Europe') announced, on 5 November 2021, that it had been informed by the Belgian Data Protection Authority ('Belgian DPA') that its Litigation Chamber is close to finalising a draft ruling that will conclude its investigation of IAB Europe and its role in the Transparency & Consent Framework ('TCF'). In particular, IAB EuropeÂ outlined that it had been informed that the draft ruling will identify infringements of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') by IAB Europe, specifically pertaining to the use ofÂ TCF 'TC Strings', the digital signals created on websites to capture data subjects'Â choices about the processing of their personal data for digital advertising, content, and measurement.
More specifically, IAB Europe outlined that the Belgian DPA's draft ruling is expected to consider TC Strings as personal data under the GDPR and IAB Europe asÂ a joint controller for such data. IAB Europe further outlined that the draft ruling is therefore expected to find it to have breached certain controller obligations under the GDPR, which IAB explained it had not fulfilled based on the fact that it had not considered itself to be a data controller in the context of the TCF.
Furthermore, IAB Europe noted that draft ruling is expected to be shared with other data protection authoritiesÂ in the coming twoÂ to threeÂ weeks under the cooperation procedure laid down in the GDPR, and that depending on the outcome of their review,Â the Belgian DPA may adopt a final ruling or the matter may be referred to the European Data Protection Board ('EDPB')Â for a binding decision. Additionally, IAB Europe outlined that the draft ruling is expected to find that the identifiedÂ infringements should be capable of being remedied within six months following the issuing of the final ruling, in a process that would involve the Belgian DPA overseeing the execution of an agreed action plan by IAB Europe.

'''The Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs ('LIBE')Â CommitteeÂ of the European Parliament held, on 17 March 2022, a public hearing on the implementation and enforcement of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR')Â and issued a follow-up statement later that day. In particular, members of the European Parliament ('MEPs'), representatives from various EU and Member State authorities, including the European Data Protection Board ('EDPB'), the European Consumer Organisation ('BEUC'), the French data protection authority ('CNIL'), the Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD'), and the Norwegian data protection authority ('Datatilsynet'), as well as business leaders in the data protection domain,Â discussed current issues in three thematic panels, namely regarding data subject rights, enforcement and collaboration, and significant cross-border cases.
Regarding data subject rights, the BEUC spokesperson notably describedÂ the GDPR experience as mixed from a consumer protection perspective, noting, among other things, that companies may not offer transparent information, may not respond to access requests, and rarely offer a right to portability, whilst the CNIL spokesperson, responding to an MEP questioning on the prospectÂ of revised legislation, suggested that revising the GDPR would risk harming the rights that citizens now have, and instead, attention should be focused on enforcement. Following the evidence presented,Â MEPs argued that people may not feel that they have the rights conferred by the GDPR due to complex processes and a lack of harmonisation, whilst alsoÂ criticising what the LIBE Committee termedÂ 'non-dissuasive finesÂ that only represent a small amount of the earnings of tech companies'. Furthermore, MEPs asked about practical solutions for harmonisation, for example a single EU template for complaints.
Regarding enforcement and collaboration, spokespersons from the AEPD, the Datatilsynet, and EDPB, among others, presented evidence. Issues highlighted by the AEPD included lack of harmonisation betweenÂ national administrative procedures, lack of resources to respond to all claims, whilst theÂ Datatilsynet also highlighted a lack of resources, among other concerns. In response to the evidence presented, MEPs highlighted their support forÂ independent national data protection authorities with sufficient resources.
Regarding cross-border cases, evidence was gathered by several key stakeholders includingÂ Maximilian Schrems of None of your business ('NOYB'), who argued thatÂ procedural issues are currently the main problem for cross-border cases and spotlighted concerns over the efficacy of the one-stop-shop mechanism. Another presenter,Â Maria Magierska, PhD Researcher at the European University Institute, called for deadlines for draft decisions in cross-border cases, in response to which MEPs questioned what kindÂ of deadlines should be introduced. Among other things, MEPs also called for the European Commission to take a more active role in enforcing the law, instead of private actors and NGOs.

The Chairman of NOYB, Max Schrems, highlighted, ""If companies realise that annoying pop-ups usually don't lead to valid consent, we should also be free from this digital plague soon. GDPR is very pragmatic on this point: Whatever is really necessary for an app is legal without consent, the rest needs a free 'yes'Â or 'no'Â option. The fight against forced consent ensures that the corporations cannot force users to consent. This is especially important so that monopolies have no advantage over small businesses.""

'''DORA will establish uniform requirements concerning the security of network and information systems supporting the business processes of financial entities needed to achieve a high common level of digital operational resilience. At the same time, the financial sector will remain within the scope of the horizontal framework on cybersecurity, such as the Directive on Security Network and Information Systems (Directive (EU) 2016/1148) ('the NIS Directive'). Meanwhile, further and sector-specific cybersecurity rules will introduced with DORA.
However, although DORA does not introduce sector-specific rules on personal data protection, indirectly substantial part of its requirements, being targeted at the security of network and information systems and ensuring digital operational resilience, will reflect the ways in which financial entities equally comply with GDPR requirements. In this respect, it is important to look at the interplay between the GDPR and DORA, specifically in the key areas where their requirements intertwine, and what would be necessary to effectively comply with them. At this point, it is noteworthy that the GDPR remains fully applicable to the financial sector, and none of the DORA requirements will derogate the general rules of GDPR.
The main addressees to the requirements of DORA will be so-called financial entities. These are credit institutions, payment institutions, e-money institutions, investment firms, crypto-asset service providers, issuers of crypto-assets, issuers of asset-referenced tokens and of significant asset-referenced tokens, central securities depositories, central counterparties, trading venues, trade repositories, managers of alternative investment funds, management companies, data reporting service providers, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, insurance intermediaries, reinsurance and ancillary insurance intermediaries, institutions for occupational retirement pensions, credit rating agencies, statutory auditors and audit firms, administrators of critical benchmarks, crowdfunding service providers, as well as securitisation repositories.
DORA will also introduce requirements which concern any undertaking providing digital or data services, including providers of cloud computing services, software, data analytics services, data centres, but excluding providers of hardware components and undertakings authorised under Union law which provide electronic communication services, which provide their services to the financial entities. These are so-called ICT third-party service providers.
Financial entities inevitably process huge amounts of personal data in the context of their services. All this data is processed, stored, and transmitted through their networks and information systems, and in cases where they use ICT third-party service providers, usually personal data is also exchanged between them and the respective providers, regardless of whether there are active data processing operations, or the ICT third-party service providers have a more of passive and indirect role with regard to the processed personal data. Thus, the GDPR applies not only to the activities of the financial entities, but also to the ICT third-party services provided to such entities as far as any personal data is processed in the context of their provision. This also indicates that it is important to look at the interplay between the GDPR and DORA.
Financial entities will be required to have in place internal well-documented ICT risk management frameworks, which enables them to address ICT risks quickly, efficiently, and comprehensively, and to ensure a high level of digital operational resilience that matches their business needs, size, and complexity. As part of this ICT risk management framework, financial entities will have to identify, classify, and adequately document all ICT-related business functions, the information assets supporting these functions, and the ICT system configurations and interconnections with internal and external ICT systems. In addition, financial entities will be obliged to review as needed, and at least yearly, the adequacy of the classification of the information assets and of any relevant documentation.
The above-mentioned identification, classification, and documentation of the information assets has been performed to a certain extent, but from a different perspective, by the financial entities to comply with the GDPR. The scope under DORA will be significantly broader since this requirement concerns not only information assets, which include personal data, but any kind of information assets. However, compliance with the GDPR and the existence of properly maintained data inventories, including registers under Article 30 of the GDPR, could facilitate the financial entities in their efforts to comply with DORA.
Another requirement that is introduced in the proposal by the Commission is the financial entities other than microenterprises, to perform a risk assessment upon each major change in the network and information system infrastructure, in the processes, or procedures, affecting their functions, supporting processes, or information assets. This requirement most probably will intertwine in certain cases with the requirements to carry out Data Protection Impact Assessments ('DPIAs') under Article 35 of the GDPR. Although not every major change in the network and information system infrastructure, the processes, or procedures, affecting their functions, supporting processes, or information assets would result in the necessity to carry out a DPIA, the risk assessment under DORA could serve as an initial assessment on whether a DPIA under the GDPR is necessary, since such a risk assessment includes an assessment of the risks related to the protection and security of personal data as far as the latter is processed in the respective networks, systems, processes, or information assets. However, these assessments will have a different scope and content.
While the GDPR adopts a risk-based approach without specifying the required technical and organisational measures as minimal standards to ensure a level of security of the processed personal data, DORA introduces specific requirements regarding the security measures that financial entities should implement. In this respect, in the future, the requirements under DORA could be considered not only mandatory for the financial entities in the context of ensuring network security and digital operational resilience, but also as an indication what should be considered as adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the personal data in the financial sector.
A specific challenge for the financial entities will be the interplay between the requirements of the GDPR and DORA for establishing and documenting respective policies and procedures, which, under DORA, should ensure the resilience, continuity, and availability of ICT systems, and maintaining high standards of security, confidentiality, and integrity of data, whether at rest, in use, or in transit. Considering the accountability principle, the provision of Article 24(2) of the GDPR and the practical aspects of implementing security measures most financial entities as data controllers already have in place certain documented security policies. With DORA's adoption, these policies will most probably need to be supplemented and updated. A specific practical challenge would be also to determine whether to develop and maintain joint policies that comply with both with GDPR and DORA requirements, or to maintain separate policies for compliance with the respective regulation.
The proposal introduces the term 'ICT-related incident', which means an unforeseen identified occurrence in the network and information systems, whether resulting from malicious activity or not, which compromises the security of network and information systems, of the information that such systems process, store, or transmit, or has adverse effects on the availability, confidentiality, continuity, or authenticity of financial services provided by the financial entity. In certain cases, such an incident may also constitute a personal data breach within the meaning of the GDPR if it leads to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed. This means that in certain cases a financial entity will have to comply with both the requirements related to an ICT-related incident and to a personal data breach, which, though having certain similarities, are different.
The main requirements regarding ICT-related incidents include:
The requirements of establishing detection mechanisms, though directed toward ICT-related incidents, will facilitate the financial entities in detecting personal data protection breaches and, thus, their compliance with the GDPR. However, in cases where an ICT-related incident also constitutes a personal data breach, this may lead to the necessity of double documentation since the requirements of the two regulations are directed toward different aspects of such an incident.
The regime of reporting is also different and involves immediate initial notification and intermediary reporting. Thus, in case of a major ICT-related incident, which also constitutes a personal data breach, the financial entity will be obliged to report to the competent authority under DORA, as well as to notify the competent data protection authority. An additional key aspect is that the deadlines for submitting the notifications under DORA are planned to be extremely short, and actually shorter that those under the GDPR for the initial notification.
The proposal introduces numerous requirements for cases when financial entities use ICT services provided by ICT third-party service providers. These involve, among others, requirements related to assessments of the ICT third-party service providers before entering into contractual agreements with them (due diligence), ensuring written contractual arrangements with such service providers which should contain some key minimal provisions, keeping a 'Register of Information' in relation to all contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services provided by ICT third-party service providers, distinguishing between those that cover critical or important functions, and those that do not, and reporting at least yearly to the competent authorities information on the number of new arrangements on the use of ICT services, the categories of ICT third-party service providers, the type of contractual arrangements, and the services and functions which are being provided.
The above requirements have certain similarities with GDPR requirements regarding the relations between data controllers and data processors. However, DORA will establish far more detailed and specific rules. All these rules will apply along with GDPR requirements, including those of Article 28.
These requirements will have significant impact to the tech companies that act as ICT third-party service providers for financial entities, since such companies will be subjected to preliminary assessments and audits, and will need to agree to contractual agreements containing the key minimal provisions under DORA which introduce specific requirements to their services. Among the mandatory contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services are the provisions on accessibility, availability, integrity, security, and protection of personal data, and on ensuring access, recover, and return in an easily accessible format of personal and non-personal data processed by the financial entity in the case of insolvency, resolution, or discontinuation of the business operations of the ICT third-party service provider. Since, as already mentioned, the GDPR remains fully applicable, these contractual arrangements should also comply with the GDPR. For example, it could be expected that in most cases such service providers will act as data processors within the meaning of the GDPR. Therefore, the contractual arrangements with such providers should also contain data processing agreements compliant with Article 28 of the GDPR. In addition, due to the interplay with DORA, such companies may need to supplement and update the security measures they implement and apply.
DORA is planned to introduce specific rules on security measures, ICT-related incidents, and relations with ICT third-parties service providers in the financial sector, which directly intertwine with those of the GDPR. None of these requirements overrides the applicability of the rules of the GDPR, but only builds on and complements them.

In particular, the guidelines provide practical guidance and interpretation concerningÂ the notion of consent and the new obligation of transparency with regard to the processing of personal data under the GDPR.
In relation to the Consent Guidelines, the WP29 highlightsÂ that its existing opinions on consent remained relevant, and therefore it had only expanded upon these rather than replacingÂ them.

In addition, the Consent Guidelines provide additional analysis of other topics, including consent obtained under the Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) and child's consent.
Regarding the Transparency Guidelines, the WP29 provides detailed interpretation of Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR as well as examples and best practices concerning the fundamental elements of transparency.

'''The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') published, on 22 June 2022, the Deputy Data Protection Ombudsman's ('the Deputy Ombudsman')Â Decision No. 6813/171/21, as issued on 31 May 2022, in which the Deputy Ombudsman found that the Hospital District of Pohjois-SavonÂ had violated with Article 25(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and Section 3 of the Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life (759/2004) ('Workplace Privacy Act'), following an investigation, and in conjunction with a 
Background to the decision
In particular, the Deputy Ombudsman outlined that it had receivied a breach notification from the Hospital District, according to which the function to allow location information to be used on employeeÂ devicesÂ was enabled by default, and employees were unable to turn the function off.Â 
Findings of the Deputy Ombudsman
Further to the above, the Deputy Ombudsman found that the Hospital District did not have a statutory need to process the location data of its employees and, additionally, had not properly reviewed what information it intended to collect. In this regard, the Deputy Ombudsman added that, as the location data of the employees have been unnecessary and inadvertently collected for the employer, this data should not have been processed by the Hospital District. Moreover, the Deputy Ombudsman considered that the Hospital District had not complied with the requirement to implement technical and organisational measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed, pursuant to Article 25(2) of the GDPR. Additionally, the Deputy Ombudsman found that the personal data collected was non-compliant with the principle of necessity, as detailed in Section 3 of the Workplace Privacy Act, noting that it is stricter than that of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Consequently, the Deputy Ombudsman issued a notice to the Hospital District about the unreasonable activation of the location data function and ordered it to delete any history data, location logs, and other personal information generated during the use of the location data function. Finally, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that the Hospital District has announced that it has disabled the location data function at employees' workstations.

'''The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') published, on 22 June 2022, the Deputy Data Protection Ombudsman's ('the Deputy Ombudsman')Â Decision No. 1141/161/22, as issued on 31 May 2022, in which the Deputy Ombudsman found that Istekki Oy had established default location settings on clients' workstations, following an investigation based on a preliminary breach notification submitted by the Hospital District of Pohjois-Savon, against which the Deputy Ombudsman issued a separate 
Background to the decision
In particular, the Deputy Ombudsman outlined that, according to the aforementioned breach notification, the function to allow location information to be enabled on employee devicesÂ was enabledÂ by default. Further to this, theÂ Deputy Ombudsman noted that it hadÂ requested clarifications from the Hospital District's ICT service provider, Istekki.
Findings of the Deputy Ombudsman
Further to the above, the Deputy Ombudsman considered that, according to a report issued by Istekki, the service hadÂ been offered to all customers using workstations they supplied with the location function on. In this regard, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that, as alleged by Istekki, the location information switch is on by default in a Windows 10 installation, and no client has requested that the setting be set, or changed, to a specific position.
Moreover, the Deputy Ombudsman stated that, pursuant to Article 4(7) of the GDPR, the responsibility for defining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data lies with the controller, i.e. theÂ Hospital District. As such, the Deputy Ombudsman outlined that, in the present case, the controller had not instructed the data processor, Istekki, as to whether the location data function should be enabled on Windows 10 workstations. However, the Deputy Ombudsman clarified that, in such a situation, the processor of the personal data should communicate with the controller and find out what personal data is to be processed.
Outcomes
Consequently, the Deputy Ombudsman instructed Istekki to ensure that the location data function is not unreasonably turned on by default on current customers' Windows 10 workstations. Furthermore, the Deputy Ombudsman stated that the Istekki must turn off the location data feature on customers' Windows 10 workstations by 8 August 2022, unless otherwise instructed by the Hospital District. Moreover, Deputy Ombudsman further instructed Istekki to provide the Ombudsman with information on which data controllers have indicated that the location data feature should not be switched off, as well as confirmation that the location data function has been switched off from other data controllers' workstations, by 19 August 2022.
Finally, the Deputy Ombudsman stated that Istekki must submit a confirmation of the measures taken to the Ombudsman by 19 August 2022. Â

'''The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') published, on 22 June 2022, the Deputy Data Protection Ombudsman's ('the Deputy Ombudsman') decision in Decision No. 2464/161/22, as issued on 31 May 2022, in which the Deputy Ombudsman found that the Valtori State Information and Communication Technology Center had not complied with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') with respect to default location settings on workstations, following an investigation.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Deputy Ombudsman outlined that, in 2022, the Ombudsman investigated the use of the location data function in Windows 10 from various municipal service providers. In connection with this investigation, a report has also been requested from the Valtori State ICT Center, dated 21 March 2022. In this regard, the Deputy Ombudsman confirmed that the Valtori State ICT Center submitted a written report on the matter on 4 April 2022.
Furthermore, the Deputy Ombudsman stated that, according to a report provided by Valtor, the location information setting is enabled by default on Windows 10 as defined by Microsoft, and the service is provided as such to all customers. As such, Valtori State ICT Center outlined that, some of its customers use location information in their work, and location information is also commonly used to improve the user experience by providing up-to-date, location-based inputs such as weather and news. In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman clarified that the Valtori State ICT Center had confirmed location information can also be used to assist in the event of a machine loss.
Findings of the Deputy Ombudsman
Further to the above, the Deputy Ombudsman found that the workstations of workstations have systematically turned on the use of location data by default, which is not compliant with the GDPR.
However, the Deputy Ombudsman also considered that the data processor, Valtori State ICT Center, processes personal data on behalf of, and in accordance with the instructions of, the data controller. As such, the Deputy Ombudsman added that, in accordance with Article 4(7) of the GDPR, the responsibility for defining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data lies with the data controller. Further to this, the Deputy Ombudsman outlined that, where the data controller has not instructed the data processor on whether, for example, the location data function should be enabled on Windows 10 workstations, it is advisable for the controller to communicate with the controller and find out what personal data is to be processed. Moreover, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that, in the absence of instructions, the data processor should not assume that, for example, the location data collection function is to be switched on and that personal data is to be collected.
In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman highlighted that the inadequacy of the data controller's instructions may lead to a data processor, such as Valtori State ICT Center, who has processed personal data other than in accordance with given instructions.
Outcomes
Consequently, the Deputy Ombudsman instructed the data controllers to ensure that the location data function is not unreasonably turned on by default on current customers' Windows 10 workstations. Furthermore, the Deputy Ombudsman also instructed the data processor, Valtori State ICT Center, to turn off the location information feature on customers' Windows 10 workstations by 8 August 2022, unless otherwise instructed by the relevant data controllers.
Moroever, the Deputy Ombudsman added that the Valtori State ICT Center must provide the Ombudsman with information on which data controllers have indicated that the location data feature should not be switched off, as well as confirmation that the location data function has been switched off from other data controllers' workstations, by 19 August 2022.
Finally, the Deputy Ombudsman instructed the relevant data controllers to delete personal data generated by the use of the location data feature, in the case of Windows 10 workstations where the location data feature has been unduly enabled.

In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman highlighted that with regard to the policies on disclosures of payment default data, the Legal Register Centre had failed to implement the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR and the principle of accuracy of personal data under Article 5(1)(d) of the GDPR, as required by the data protection by design obligation under Article 25(1) of the GDPR and the controller's responsibility under Article 24 of the GDPR.

'''The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') announced, on 29 July 2022, that a Swedish investment services company has been found to have breached the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') by failing to adequately facilitate the exercise of data subjects' rights, according to a decision on cross-border cooperation between data protection authorities in the EU.
Background to the Decision 
In particular, the Ombudsman noted that the company had asked customers to provide information for identity verification purposes by post, although it also had a digital channel for this purpose. In addition, the Ombudsman stated that it had received two complaints concerning the company's identification practices. Furthermore, the Ombudsman noted that the case was dealt with in a cross-border procedure of cooperation between European data protection authorities, in which the Ombudsman, the Norwegian data protection authority, and the Danish data protection authorityÂ were involved as concerned supervisory authorities. Moreover, the Ombudsman outlined that the decision was adopted by the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection ('IMY') acting as the lead supervisory authority.
Findings of the data protection authoritiesÂ 
In particular, the Ombudsman noted that according to the decision, a controller can only in exceptional cases provide regular mail service as the sole means of communication for the transmission of information necessary to verify identity, noting that this may be justified, for example, for security reasons, however, in principle, alternative means of transmission should be offered. In addition, the Ombudsman outlined that the investment service provider has been using a digital service with an authentication feature for other customer communications. Furthermore, the Ombudsman stated that the data protection authorities consider that where a controller has a digital communication channel that allows for authentication of identity, then a more cumbersome way to exercise the customer's data protection rights should not be required without a specific justification. Moreover, the Ombudsman noted that no such evidence was provided that would have justified the company requiring the customer to send the data by post.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Ombudsman noted that the IMY issued a warning to the company for breach of the GDPR.

The Ombudsman highlighted that legitimate interests may allow the processing of personal data in relation to direct marketing, scientific and historical research and statistics, or the transfer of personal data for administrative reasons within the group. The Guidance outlines that the balance test should be carried out by the controller in six steps, namely considering whether it is the most appropriate processing basis; whether the processing is necessary to achieve the interest; if the basic requirements are met in order to be considered legitimate; an evaluation of the impact of the processing; additional safeguards, as well as ensuring transparency of the balance test.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that the data subject had lodged a complaint to the Ombudsman on 23 October 2019 claiming that the medial clinic had not complied with the data subject's request to access their patient data. In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman stated that the Ombudsman had asked the medical clinic for information on, among other things, which body it considers to be the controller of patient data in relation to the clinic owner's office visits, however, the medical clinic did not provide an adequate explanation.
Findings of the Deputy Ombudsman and the Board
In particular, the Deputy Ombudsman found that the medical clinic had not exercised the data subject's right of access to their own data in accordance with Articles 15(1) and (3) of the GDPR nor provided a reason for limiting this right pursuant to Article 12(4) of the GDPR. In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman found that the controller did not comply with the time limits for processing the data subject's request in accordance with Article 12(3) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that in the absence of any explanation from the controller as to how it has provided information to data subjects, the Deputy Ombudsman must consider, on the basis of the information otherwise available to it, that the medical clinic did not adequately inform its clients about the processing of personal data as required under Articles 12(1) and 13(1) and (2) of the GDPR. Moreover, the Deputy Ombudsman emphasised that in this respect, the medical clinic did not inform its clients about the extent to which it acts as a controller of patient data generated by its activities.
Furthermore, the Deputy Ombudsman considered that the medical clinic had not followed an approach in its activities that takes into account Data Protection by Design and Default under Article 25 of the GDPR in its processing operations, and had not effectively implemented the principle of transparency in accordance with Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR. Moreover, the Board considered that the medical clinic's conduct was systematic and that the infringement was long-lasting and affected a large number of data subjects.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Board fined the medical clinic â‚¬5,000 for GDPR violations. In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman ordered the medical clinic to comply with the data subject's requests to exercise their right of access to their data, in so far as it relates to data for which the medical clinic is the controller and to bring its processing operations into compliance with the GDPR in relation to the procedures for the exercise of data subjects' rights and informing data subjects.

In particular, the Ombudsman stated that the practiceÂ of the Motor Insurers' Centre violated the principle of data minimisation pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR. In addition, the Ombudsman noted that the Motor Insurance Act (460/2016) does not justify direct access to all patient data, but that the requested information must be necessary for the resolution of the claim. Hence, the Ombudsman highlighted that as a general rule, an insurer cannot ask for all information concerning a client's treatment, instead, the requested information must be limited and identified on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, the Ombudsman stated that the practice of the Motor Insurers' Centre also failed to meet the conditions of fairness of the processing of personal data as the claimant hadÂ a legitimate expectation that the insurance company will process only data that is necessary for the decision on compensation. Moreover, the Ombudsman noted that according to the Board, the behaviour of the Motor Insurers' Centre shows that it had not sufficiently familiarised itself with the requirements of data protection legislation. Lastly, the Ombudsman stated that the fact that sensitive health data was processed was one of the factors that justified the imposition of the fine.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Board imposed the aforementioned fine of â‚¬52,000 to the Motor Insurers' Centre, and the Ombudsman issued a warning to the Motor Insurers' Centre for data protection violations and ordered to change its policy on requesting patient data to comply with data protection rules. Lastly, the Ombudsman noted that an appeal against the decision may be lodged in an administrative court.

'''The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') published, on 5 July 2022, its decision in Decision No. 6097/161/21, as issued on 9 May 2022, in which the Sanctions Board of the Ombudsman ('the Sanctions Board') imposed a fine of â‚¬85,000 to Otavamedia Oy, for violations of Articles 5(1)(c), 12, 15, 17, and 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following complaints.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Ombudsman stated that it had received 11 complaints between 2018 and 2021 concerning Otavamedia's processing of personal data, noting that the complainants had not, among other things, received responses to their data subjectÂ requests or inquiries. In addition, the Ombudsman stated that according to Otavamedia's explanation, some of the data subject requests were not responded toÂ due to technical problems with email control in connection with the change of service provider,Â and during the error, messages received in the inbox reserved for data protection issues had not been forwarded to customer service. Furthermore, the Ombudsman outlined that the situation was only discovered following a request for clarification from the Ombudsman, and thatÂ the email error had lasted for seven months.
Findings of the Ombudsman 
In particular, the Ombudsman found that Otavamedia should have tested the inbox as it was the main electronic channel for data subjects to communicate data protection issues to Otavamedia. In addition, the Ombudsman stated that data subjects have been able to make access and erasure requests to Otavamedia using a printable form which required the signature of the person for identification purposes. However, the Ombudsman considered that via this practice, Otavamedia has collected an unnecessarily large amount of data for identification purposes. Furthermore, the Ombudsman noted that Otavamedia does not process the signature data in other contexts, which means that the signature could not, for example, be compared with previously held data. Moreover, the Ombudsman recalled that the exercise of data subject rights must not be made more difficult by the controller, for example, certain formal requirements cannot be imposed on data protection requests without a legitimate reason.
Outcomes
As a result, the Sanctions Board imposed a fine of â‚¬85,000 to Otavamedia for failure to respond to data subject rights via the email channel. In addition, the Ombudsman ordered Otavamedia to correct its practices in compliance with data protection rules and to abandon the requirement to sign the form. Furthermore, the Ombudsman issued a warning to Otavamedia for failure to respect the rights of the data subject. Lastly, the Ombudsman stated that an appeal may be lodged against the decisions of the Ombudsman and the Sanctions Board with an administrative court.

'''The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') published, on 16 December 2021, the Deputy Data Protection Ombudsman's ('the Deputy Ombudsman') and the Sanctions Board of the Ombudsman's ('the Board') decision in 1150/161/2021, as issued on 7 December 2021, in which the Deputy Ombudsman issued a warning to Psykoterapiakeskus Vastaamo Oy ('Vastaamo') for violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 24(1), 25(1), 32(1), 32(2), 33(1), 33(5), 34(1), and 35(7) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and the Board also imposed a fine of â‚¬608,000 to Vastaamo for violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 33(1), and 34(1) of the GDPR following the 
Background to the decision
In particular, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that in September 2020, Vastaamo had notified the Ombudsman of a personal data breach of its patient database. In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that it had, in October 2020, ordered Vastaamo to 
Findings of the Deputy Ombudsman and the Board
In particular, the Deputy Ombudsman stated that, based on the information collected during the investigation, Vastaamo must have become aware already, in March 2019, that the data in the patient database had been lost and could have been accessed by an external attacker, hence, Vastaamo should have reported the personal data breach to both the Ombudsman and its customers, without delay, pursuant to Articles 33(1) and 34(1) of the GDPR, as the breach had put data subjects at high risk. In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that since Vastaamo had not documented the personal data breach as required under Article 33(5) of the GDPR, it could not demonstrate that it had complied with appropriate security requirements.
In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman stated that Vastaamo's Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') did not meet the DPIA requirements under Article 35(7) of the GDPR and Vastaamo had also failed to process personal data in accordance with the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the Deputy Ombudsman outlined that Vastaamo had not complied with the requirements of Articles 24(1), 25(1), 32(1), and 32(2) of the GDPR, as required by the principle of integrity and confidentiality of personal data. Moreover, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that Vastaamo had failed to comply with the principle of accountability under Article 5(2) of the GDPR as it had failed to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR.
In addition, the Board noted that the infringements by Vastaamo were very serious in nature and Vastaamo's behaviour in failing to notify the personal data breach was considered to be intentional. Furthermore, the Board stated that Vastaamo's negligence in protecting the data could be considered grossly negligent and that the breaches had lasted for a long time. Moreover, the Board highlighted that the measures taken by Vastaamo to minimise the damage caused to data subjects were considered as a mitigating factor, while aggravating factors included, for example, the sensitivity of the data processed and the shortcomings in the documentation of the personal data breach.
Outcomes
The Deputy Ombudsman issued a warning to Vastaamo for violating Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 24(1), 25(1), 32(1), 32(2), 33(1), 33(5), 34(1), and 35(7) of the GDPR. In addition, the Board imposed a fine of â‚¬145,600 for violation of Article 33(1) of the GDPR, â‚¬145,600 for violation of Article 34(1) of the GDPR and â‚¬316,800 for violation of Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR. Hence, the total amount of the administrative fine is â‚¬608,000.

'''The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') published, on 27 May 2022, its decision in Decision No. 10587/161/21, as issued on 29 April 2022, in which the Sanctions Board of the Ombudsman imposed a fine of â‚¬8,300 to an unnamed telemarketing company selling natural products, for violations of Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following its failure to comply with the Ombudsman's previous order to provide the data subject access to their data.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Ombudsman stated that the unnamed telemarketing company had not exercised the data subject's request to access a recording of a sales call made to them. In addition, the Ombudsman noted that it had ordered the telemarketing company to comply with the request on 23 July 2021. However, the Ombudsman outlined that the data subject had notified it that they still had not received access to the recording despite the Ombudsman's order. Furthermore, the Ombudsman stated that the recording was provided to the data subject only after the Ombudsman had taken action against the non-compliance and sent the company a request for a hearing on the sanction.
Findings of the Ombudsman
In particular, the Sanctions Board held that the telemarketing company had not complied with the Ombudsman's order to carry out the access request appropriately and within a reasonable time. In addition, the Ombudsman stated that, on the one hand, the lack of cooperation with the supervisory authority must be taken into account as an aggravating circumstance, whilst, on the other hand, the fact that the controller has taken measures to mitigate the damage caused to the data subject is considered as a mitigating circumstance.
Outcomes
As a result, the Sanctions Board imposed a fine of â‚¬8,300 on the telemarketing company for failure to comply with the Ombudsman's previous order. In addition, the Ombudsman noted that this is its first decision to impose a fine on a controller for non-compliance with its order.

'''The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') published, on 27 January 2022, the Ombudsman's and the Sanctions Board of the Ombudsman's ('the Board') decision in case no. 4282/161/21, as issued on 16 December 2021, in which theÂ Board imposed a fine of â‚¬6,500 to an unnamed travel agency, for violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 17(1), 25(1), and 32(1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint from a data subject.
Background to the decision 
In particular, the Ombudsman stated that it had received a complaint on 30 September 2019 concerning the secure processing of personal data and the data subject's right to be forgotten. In addition, the Ombudsman noted that the complainant had reported that the travel agency did not seem to process the data in the electronic visa application form in compliance withÂ the data protection laws. Furthermore, the Ombudsman noted that the complainant had also requested the deletion of their data, but the controller had not responded to this request. Moreover, the Ombudsman stated that the travel agency had been declared bankrupt in January 2021.
Findings of the Ombudsman
In particular, the Ombudsman stated that the travel agency's websites and electronic visa application wereÂ behind an unencrypted HTTP connection, and it also stored a PDF-file containing the complainant's personal data on the open network. In addition, the Ombudsman noted that the stored data included, among other things, names, contact details, and passport numbers. Furthermore, the Ombudsman highlighted that when combined with the other personal data, the passport number was especially a risk factor. Hence, the Ombudsman found that the travel agency had violated its obligations to process personal data in a secure manner and also failed to exercise the data subject's request to erasure.
In addition, the Ombudsman noted that the aggravating factors to be taken into account in the assessment include, among other things, the passivity of the travel agency in dealing with the case and taking corrective measures, the travel agency's disregard for data protection laws, the systematic nature of the breach, the intentional natureÂ of the breach, and the passivity of the travel agency in taking measures to mitigate the damage caused to the data subject. On the other hand, the Ombudsman noted that the mitigating factors to be taken into account were the fact that the personal data did not fall under Articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR, and that the travel agency had not collected any data of minors or personal identifiers of applicantsÂ through the website.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Board imposed the aforementioned fine of â‚¬6,500 to the travel agency and the Ombudsman ordered it to delete unsecured files containing personal data from the network. In addition, the Ombudsman issued a warning to the travel agency pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR since its processing operations were in breach of the GDPR. Lastly, the Ombudsman noted that an appeal may be lodged in an administrative court.

'''The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') announced, on 05Â AugustÂ 2020, that the Sanctions Chamber of the Ombudsman ('theÂ Sanctions Chamber'), had issued a decision ('the Decision') in which it had finedÂ Independent Consulting Oy (Acc Consulting Varsinais-Suomi)Â â‚¬7,000 for sending electronic direct marketing messages without prior consent and for non-compliance with the data subjectÂ rights. In particular, the Decision relates to 11Â complaints received by the Ombudsman relating toÂ the company's direct electronic marketing and non-exercise of data subject rights under theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In addition, the Sanctions ChamberÂ held that the company could not rely on the defence that it had conductedÂ targeted electronic direct marketing to entities which do not require consent underÂ the Act on Electronic Communications Services (917/2014), as the company had not conducted any assessments prior to the marketing considering, among other things,Â  the recipient's job.Â 
Moreover, the Decision notes thatÂ some of the complaints concerned the fact that data subjects had made requests to the controller for their rights under the GDPR and that the controller hadÂ not responded to the requests as required without undue delay and within a maximum of one month of receipt of the request. In addition, the Decision highlightsÂ that the controller did not appear to have organised its procedures for processing personal data in such a way that it can indicate whether itÂ hadÂ exercised the data subjects' rights or received requests for rights and that therefore wasÂ unable to demonstrate that itÂ hadÂ processed personal data lawfully.
Lastly, the Decision outlines that the Deputy Ombudsman of the OfficeÂ also obliges the controller to rectify its conduct with regard to direct marketing and has ordered the company to change its practices and exercise the data subject's rights in accordance with the GDPR.

In addition, the ACPR noted that in respect to the transfer of funds, payment service providers must have in place internal management procedures for detecting a possible absence of information on the principal and beneficiary, as well as to monitor compliance with AML/CFT requirements.
Further to this, the ACPR found that there were no adequate internal management procedures to detect information missing with respect to fund transfers and payment service providers of intermediaries.

In particular, CNIL outlined that the Acts both require, from different perspectives, two key elements to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'):
In light of this, CNIL recognised the legitimate objectives of the DGA to foster the availability of data through the establishment of data intermediary structures and strengthening data sharing mechanisms across the EU, and welcomed the Data Act's objectives to develop valuable knowledge for sectors such as science, health, or climate action, and to facilitate the right to data portability. Simultaneously, the authorities called on the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to ensure that the Acts do not undermine the protection of personal data, requesting that additional safeguards for data subjects be implemented under the Data Act and that that GDPR should take precedence in cases of conflict with the DGA.
In relation to governance, CNIL called for data protection authorities to be designated as coordinating authorities for the application of the Data Act in its entirety, given the legal and technical expertise in the area.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 10 February 2022, that it had issued an order against an unnamed French website operator to comply with Chapter V of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('GDPR'), having found that transfers of personal data to the USÂ carried out via use of Google Analytics were non-compliant with Article 44 of the GDPR, in light of the the Court of Justice of the European Union's ('CJEU') judgment inÂ 
Background to the case
On 17 August 2020, NOYB filedÂ 101Â complaints against EU website operators that continue to send website visitor data to Google LLC and Facebook Inc.Â (now Meta Platforms, Inc.), allegedly in continued violation of the GDPR despite the ruling in the Schrems II Case. On 13 January 2022, NOYB published the first decision to be issued following the filing of its complaints - a 
For further context, CNIL outlined thatÂ Google Analytics, a service that can be integrated by websites such as online sale sites in order to measure the number of visits by internet users, works by assigningÂ a unique identifier to each visitor, which, CNIL highlighted, constitutes personal data, and which is subsequently transferred to the USÂ along with additional associated data, andÂ thus subject to Chapter V of the GDPR.
In addition to the above, CNIL explained that it had cooperated with itsÂ European counterparts toÂ assess the lawfulness ofÂ the conditions under which the data collected through this service is transferred to the US.
Findings of CNIL
In particular, CNIL highlighted that the transfer of personal data to the USÂ may only take place ifÂ appropriate guarantees are provided for, and found that this was not the case with the website operator's use of Google Analytics. Specifically, CNIL outlined thatÂ although Google hadÂ adopted additional measures to regulate data transfers in the context of the Google Analytics functionality, these were not sufficient to exclude the accessibility of this data for US intelligence services. Consequently, CNIL found that the use of Google Analytics in this case implies that the data of internet users is transferred to the USÂ in violation of Articles 44 
Outcomes
In view of the above findings, CNILÂ ordered the website operator to bring its processing into compliance with the GDPR, if necessary by ceasing to use Google Analytics (under the current conditions) or by using a tool that does not involve a transfer of personal data outside the EU. Furthermore, CNIL noted that the website operator has one month to comply.
In addition, CNIL highlighted that current investigations by CNIL and its EU counterpartsÂ also extendÂ to other tools used by sites that result in the transfer of the data of EU internet users to the US, further emphasising thatÂ corrective measures in this respect may be adopted in the near future.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 25 April 2017, that it had fined ALLOCAB SAS, a taxi services company, â‚¬15,000 for persistent violations of Act No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties. In particular, in 2015, CNIL found a number of shortcomings and gave ALLOCAB a formal notice requiring it to define retention periods for the data present in its database, retain the data relating to customers' bank cards only for the time necessary for the completion of the transaction, purge data of customers who requested the deletion of their accounts, and take all the necessary measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data within three months.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 10 December 2020, its deliberationÂ imposingÂ on Amazon Europe Core Sarl a fine of â‚¬35 million for cookieÂ violations under Article 82 of the Act No.78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Information Technology, Data Files and Civil Liberties (as amended to implement the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR')). In particular, the Restricted Committee of CNIL highlighted that after conducting investigations from 12 December 2019 to 19 May 2019 on the website amazon.fr, it found that when a user visited the website, cookies were placed automatically on theirÂ computer in the absence of any action by the user. In regards to this automatic placement of cookies, CNIL found that such placement of cookies at the time the user entered the website was incompatible with the requirement to obtain the user's prior consent. In addition, CNIL noted that the use of browser settings as a valid mechanism for collecting consent depends on the user beingÂ informedÂ that they have a possibility to consent through browser settings beforehand, which hadÂ not happened in the case of Amazon's website.
Moreover, CNIL found that there was insufficient information provided to users upon entering the Amazon website asÂ the information banner statedÂ that by using the website, users accept the use of cookies, and so foundÂ that the user could not understand that cookies placed on their device would be used for displaying personalised ads. Lastly, CNIL considered that, through the banner, the users had not received adequate information on their ability to object to the use of cookies and that, therefore, Amazon had not complied with its obligation to adequately inform users about the use of cookies for advertisement purposes.
On the basis of the above and considering that Amazon'sÂ cookie practices had taken place for a long time, as well asÂ the fact that the Amazon website is accessed by millions of people who are subject to the storage of cookies on their website, theÂ Restricted CommitteeÂ fined Amazon â‚¬35 million. In addition, it ordered Amazon to adequately inform individuals about the use of cookies within three months after receiving the notification of the deliberation.

In particular, CNIL noted that Bouygues had failed toÂ sufficientlyÂ protectÂ the data of more than two million of its customers for more than two years, by allowing access to contracts and invoices via a modification of a URL address on its website, thus violating its obligations on security and confidentiality of data under Article 34 of ActÂ No.78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties.

In particular, CNIL outlined that Brico PrivÃ© had failed toÂ respect the data retention periods that it had set, in violation of Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, with respect to the data of 146,000 customers, whilstÂ also noting that it had failed to respect transparency obligations, the right to erasure, and data security obligations, in violation of Articles 13, 17, and 32 of the GDPR respectively.
In addition, CNIL highlighted thatÂ Brico PrivÃ© had sent prospecting emails to individuals who had created an account on their website but had not made a purchase, without the prior consent of such individuals, in violation ofÂ Article L. 34-5 of the Code, as well as placing advertising cookies without consent, in violation of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. Furthermore, with respect to the direct marketing violation, CNIL outlined that it had issued an injunction of compliance, whilst also noting, in relation to the cookies violation,Â thatÂ Brico PrivÃ© had modified the functioning of its website to the effect thatÂ advertising cookies are no longer deposited without consent.Â

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 20 October 2022, that it hadÂ issued, on 20 September 2022, the Deliberation of CNIL's Restricted Committee No. SAN-2022-019 of 17 October 2022, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬20 million on Clearview AI Inc., for violation of Articles 6, 12, 15, 17, and 31 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following complaints by individuals and data protection authorities.
Background to the decision
In particular, CNIL highlighted that it and various other European data protection authorities had received complaints regarding Clearview AI's use of facial recognition software. In addition, CNIL outlined it had received complaints from individuals in May and December 2020 regarding the difficulties they encountered when exercising their rights of access and erasure.
Findings of CNIL
During the course of its investigation, CNIL provided Clearview AI two months to comply with the provisions of Articles 6, 12, 15, and 17 of the GDPR.
More specifically, CNIL outlined that Clearview AI's facial recognition software is based on the systematic and widespread collection of images containing faces, and is subsequently used for commercial purposes, including the provision of data to law enforcement agencies in the US. Accordingly, CNIL noted that from the outset, Clearview AI had notÂ obtained consent from persons whose personal data had been processed, and was found to have violated Article 6 of the GDPR owing to the absence of a legal basis for processing of personal data.
Further, CNIL detailed that Clearview AI failed to respond effectively to data subject requests for access, and failed to facilitate this right where applicable, responding to complainant's requests in casesÂ only after seven letters and four months after initial requests were made. Consequently, CNIL found that Clearview AI failed in its obligation to facilitate the right of access and refrained from providing a satisfactory response, thereby violating Articles 12 and 15 of the GDPR.
In addition, CNIL provided that Clearview AI did not respond to complainant's requests to erase their personal data. Resultantly, CNIL found that Clearview AI had breached Article 17 of the GDPR.
Finally, CNIL established that Clearview AI did not respond to CNIL's requests for cooperation within the specified timeframe, and failed to submit any observations in defence, including a formal questionnaire to which Clearview AI only partially responded to. Accordingly, CNIL provided that Clearview AI had breached Article 31 of the GDPRÂ in failing to cooperate with a supervisory authority.

Further to this, CNIL found that the data controller and its data processor had failed to take adequate measures to ensure the security of customers' personal data, thus acting in violation of Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('GDPR'). More specifically, CNIL considered that the data controller and processor had been slow in creating a tool for detecting and blocking cyber attacks, as well as notedÂ that they had failed to take measures, such as using CAPTCHA for user account authentication or limiting the number of requests per IP address.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 21 April 2022, that it had issued, on 15 April 2022,Â decision No.Â SAN-2022-009Â of its restricted committee in which it fined Dedalus Biologie, a software solution provider for medicial analysis laboratories,Â â‚¬1.5 million for violations of Articles 28, 29, and 32 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a data breach.Â 
Background to the case
Specifically, CNIL outlined that, on 23 February 2021, a dataÂ breachÂ from two laboratories which Dedalus Biologie serviced was revealed in the press, concerningÂ nearly 500,000 individuals andÂ affecting various types of data including medical information (such as illnesses, genetic diseases, pregnancies, drug treatments followed by the patient, or even genetic data),Â and was subsequently investigated by CNIL.
Findings of CNIL
In particular, CNIL found that Dedalus Biologie, to the extent that itÂ provides laboratories with the tools, in particular computer software, to facilitate the implementation of processing, and acts only in the name and under the responsibility of the laboratories for the maintenance of the software and, if necessary, the migration to another software, for example, acts as a processor within the meaning of Article 4(8) of the GDPR in respect of personal data processing in question.Â Consequently, CNILÂ found Dedalus Biologie to beÂ inÂ breach of Article 28(3)Â of the GDPR, given that the contractual documents concluded between Dedalus Biologie and its customers did not provide for the information stipulated under the aforementioned provision.
In terms of the data breach itself, CNIL found that, as part of the migration of dataÂ from one tool to another, as requested by two laboratories using the services of Dedalus Biologie, the latter extracted a larger volume of data than required, and therefore processed data beyond the instructions given by the data controllers, in breach of Article 29 of the GDPR.
Finally, CNIL observed various shortcomings in terms of technical and organisational measures to secure the leaked data in the context of the abovementioned data migration, including:
Therefore, CNIL found that Dedalus Biologie was in breach of Article 32 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
In view of the above, and consideringÂ theÂ violation of affected data subjects' privacy as particularly harmful due to, among other things, the sensitive nature of the data in question,Â and the negligences committed by Dedalus Biologie deemed to beÂ multiple and serious, CNIL decided to impose a fine of the aforementioned amount and to publish the decision.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') published, on 4 January 2022, its decision No. SAN-2021-021, as issued on 28 December 2021, in which it fined Free Mobile SAS â‚¬300,000 forÂ violations of Articles 12, 15, 21, 25 and 32 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following complaints from data subjects concerning difficulties encountered in exercising their rights of access and to object to receiving direct marketing messages.
Background to the caseÂ 
Specifically, CNIL outlined that it had received several complaints concerning Free Mobile's alleged failures to sufficiently respond toÂ their access requests and objectionsÂ to receiving commercial prospecting messages. CNIL further outlined that on the basis of such complaints, it had conducted both on-site and off-site audits to investigate Free Mobile.
Findings of CNIL
In particular, CNIL outlined that it had identified four breaches of the GDPR.
Firstly, CNIL highlighted that Free Mobile had notÂ followed up on access requests made by complainants within the time limits stipulated under the GDPR, in violation ofÂ ArticlesÂ 12 and 15 of the GDPR. In addition, CNIL found that Free Mobile took no action with respect to requests to object to processing related to direct marketing messages, in violation of Articles 12 and 21 of the GDPR. Moreover, CNIL found that Free Mobile hadÂ continued to send complainants invoices for telephone numbers whose contractsÂ had been terminated, in violation of the Data Protection by Design principle under Article 25 of the GDPR. Lastly, CNIL highlighted that Free Mobile hadÂ transmitted by email the passwords of users when they subscribed to an offer with Free Mobile,Â without these passwords being temporary orÂ Free Mobile requiring users to change them, finding in this a breach of the obligation to ensure data security in violation of Article 32 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
In view of the above, and taking into accountÂ the size and financial situation of Free Mobile, CNIL decided to impose a financial penalty in the aforementioned amount. Additionally, CNIL highlighted that the publication of the decision was justified to serve as a reminderÂ of the importance of dealing with data subject requestsÂ and data security.

Background to the decision
In particular, CNIL reported that, following the complaint, it had launched an online inspection of the website infogreffe.fr, which allows users to consult legal information on companies and to order documents certified by the commercial court registries. More specifically, CNIL explained that the checks focused on the retention periods defined and the security measures implemented by G.I.E. INFOGREFFE.
Findings of CNIL
Further to the above, during its investigations, CNIL noted several shortcomings concerning the processing of the personal data of the service's users, i.e. people who have created an account to view or order a document and subscribers with an annual subscription. Specifically, CNIL found that G.I.E. INFOGREFFE had failed to comply with the obligation to retain data for a period of time proportionate to the purpose of the processing (Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR). In fact, CNIL outlined that the personal data (including bank details, surnames, first names, postal, and email addresses) of 25% of the service's users was kept for longer than the period defined by G.I.E. INFOGREFFE (i.e. 36 months from the last order for a service and/or document).
Moreover, CNIL determined that G.I.E. INFOGREFFE had breached Article 32 of the GDPR as it did not require the use of a strong password when creating an account on its website and that it was practically impossible for account holders to enter a secure password. In addition, CNIL found that G.I.E. INFOGREFFE had transmitted in clear text, by email, the non-temporary passwords allowing access to the accounts and also kept in clear text, in its database, the passwords, as well as the secret questions and answers used during the password reset procedure by users.
Outcomes
In conclusion, CNIL fined G.I.E. INFOGREFFE â‚¬250,000 and noted that the decision was taken in cooperation with the other European authorities concerned.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') published, on 6 January 2022, decision No. SAN-2021-023, as issued on 31 December 2021, in which it fined Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited â‚¬90 million and â‚¬60 million respectively for failing to make it as easy to reject consent to the use of cookies as it is to accept the same onÂ google.fr and youtube.com, in violation of Article 82 ofÂ Act No.78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties ('the Act'), following an online audit conducted by CNIL as part of its wider 
Background to the case
CNIL outlined that following an online check carried out on the google.frÂ and youtube.com websites on 1 June 2021, it made various observations regarding the cookie banners, privacy policies, and terms of services of the websites in question, which it sent on to Google in the form of a report requesting further information onÂ each of the cookies mentioned in the said report, their purposes, and the number of daily unique visitors to each websiteÂ over the last twelve months from France. CNIL further outlined that Google responded to that request on 9 July 2021, putting forward that the provision of its response was without prejudice to its rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), in particular the one-stop-shop mechanism, and theÂ Irish Data Protection Commission's ('DPC') role as lead supervisroy authority in investigations.
In addition, CNIL noted that following its subsequent notification of its intention to fine Google for violations identified in the aforementioned online check, Google had put forth a number of arguments in its defence, notbaly arguing that CNIL's 
With respect to Google's assertion that the DPC should be considered the lead supervisory authority and as such that CNIL is not competent to rule on this matter, CNIL outlined, among other things, that insofar as the case concerns specific rules relating to the use of cookies, the rules of the ePrivacy Directive prevail as 
Findings of CNIL
In particular, CNIL observed thatÂ the banner displayed on the google.frÂ and youtube.comÂ sites contain a button allowing immediate acceptance of cookies, but that no similar means are offered to the user to be able to as easily refuseÂ the deposit of such cookies. CNIL additionally observed that to refuse cookies, users must perform at least five actions (firstly click on the 'customise'Â button, then click on each of the three buttons to select 'disabled'Â - each button corresponding to 'personalization of the search',Â 'YouTube history', and 'ad personalisation', and finally a click on 'confirm'), rather than single action to accept them. EmphasisingÂ the principle established under its cookies recommendations and guidelines, thatÂ data controllers must offer users both the possibility of accepting and refusing cookies and other trackers with the same degree of simplicity, CNIL held that such refusal mechanism does not offer the same degree of ease as the mechanism to express consent, therefore disregarding the rules regardingÂ freedom of consent.Â CNIL therefore consideredÂ that making the mechanism for refusing cookies more complex than the mechanism forÂ accepting them in fact amounts to discouraging users from refusing cookies and encouraging them to favourÂ the ""I accept"" button. Thus, CNIL found that the methods of refusing cookies implemented by Google violate the requirements of Article 82 of the Act.
In terms of responsibility for the identified unlawful processing in question, CNIL identified Google Ireland Limited, whichÂ Google itselfÂ identified as the relevant data controller, and Google LLC, whose controllership Google disputed, as joint controllers, notably citing, among other things, Google's own assertion that Google LLC 'designs and builds the technology of Google products and that with regard to cookies deposited and read when using the search engine Google Search, there is no difference in technology between the cookies deposited from the different versions of the search engine' to come to the conclusion that Google LLC determinesÂ the means of processingÂ andÂ plays a fundamental role in the entire decision-making process relating to the processing in question.
Outcomes
In view of the above, and taking into accountÂ the respective responsibilities of the two entities and theirÂ financial situations,Â CNIL decided to impose a fine of â‚¬90 million on Google LLC and a fine of â‚¬60 million on Google Ireland Limited. In addition to the lump sum financial penalties, CNIL also ordered Google to bring their operations into compliance with the identified violated rules within three months, also providing that additional fines of â‚¬100,000 per day would be imposed for non-compliance following the end of such period.Â

Furthermore, CNIL held that Google did not have a legal basis,Â under Article 6 of the GDPR, for the processing of user data for personalised advertising, as consent had not been validly collected, since it was not specific or unambiguous, and users were not sufficiently informed as to the extent to which they were consenting to the data processing.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 10 December 2020, that it had issued, on 7 December 2020, two fines totalling â‚¬100 million against Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited for cookie violations. In particular, CNIL outlined that it had, on 16 March 2020, completed an audit of google.fr which revealed that cookies, many of which were used for marketing purposes, were automatically placed on user equipment without affirmative action.
Specifically, CNIL highlighted three violations of Article 82 of the Act No.78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Information Technology, Data Files and Civil Liberties (as amended to implement the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR')) ('the Act'). Firstly, CNIL noted that cookies for marketing purposes, which are non-essential for the provision of Google'sÂ services, were automatically placed on the users' equipment without their prior consent. Secondly, CNIL found that the information banner was accompanied by two buttons to 'Remind me later' and 'Access now', which does not provide the user with any information in relation to the automatic placement of cookies on the users' equipment. Thirdly, CNIL indicated that the opt-out mechanism was partially defective, considering that, when a user deactivated personalised ads through the 'Consult now' button, one of the advertisement cookies remained on their computer and as such continued to read their information.
As a result, CNIL imposed a fine of â‚¬60 million against Google LLC, as the developer of the Google Search engine, and â‚¬40 million against Google Ireland Limited, Google's European headquarters, which CNIL found to be jointly responsible in determining the purposes and manner in which cookies are utilised. In the calculation of the fine, CNIL stated that it had considered factors such as the severity of committing three violations of the Act, the impact on 50 million users of Google Search, the financial gain indirectly generated by the collection of personal data through advertising cookies, and the fact that, since an update from September 2020, advertising cookies are no longer automatically placed on user equipment from arrival to google.fr.

Background to the case
CNIL outlined that following an online check carried out on the facebook.com domain, on 8 AprilÂ 2021, further to complaints received between October 2020 and March 2021, it had sent two questionnaires to Facebook France and Facebook Ireland Limited requesting them to specify the purposes of the cookies deposited from the 'facebook.com' website toÂ the terminal devices of users residing in France and to have them confirm that Facebook Ireland Limited was indeed responsible for the processing operations in question. CNIL further outlined that following Facebook's responses to such request and their confirmation of Facebook Ireland Limited's controllership, it notified Facebook,Â on 1 September 2021,Â of its intention to fine Facebook Ireland Limited and impose an injunction ordering Facebook to bring the operations in question into conformity with the violated rules. Lastly, CNIL highlighted that at the conclusion of a series of communications between Facebook and CNIL, Facebook had sent CNIL evidence of an update deployed to the cookie banner on facebook.com.
Findings of CNIL
In particular, CNIL noted that it had observed thatÂ when a user accesses facebook.com, a pop-up window with the title ""Accept cookies from Facebook in this browser""appears and, at the bottom of this window, there are two buttons entitled ""Manage data parameters"" and"" Accept all"".Â CNIL also observed thatÂ at this stage no cookie was placed in the user's terminal and that the user was obliged to click on one of these two buttons to be able to continue browsing.
CNIL further clarified thatÂ when the user clicks on the ""Accept all"" button appearing at the bottom of this first window, and by this action gives their consent to the deposit of cookies on their terminal device, the window disappears, allowing the userÂ to continue browsing. On the other hand, CNIL explained that when the user clicks on the ""Manage data settings"" button, a new pop-up window appears, comprising the two main purposes pursued by cookies subject to consent - personalised advertising carried out by Facebook and personalized advertising carried out by third parties - and next to which are sliding buttons, disabled by default. CNIL finally noted that when the user scrolls through this second window, leaves the two sliding buttons disabled, then clicks on the ""Accept cookies"" button at the bottom of this window, the window disappears, allowing them to continue browsing the social network without any advertising cookies having been placed on their terminal device.
Based on the above facts, and citing the requirements of Article 4(11) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') (i.e. that consent must be a 'freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject'sÂ wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action') and Recital 42 of the GDPR (i.e. that consent 'should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment'), CNIL found that Facebook had not provided users with a means of freely providing their consent insofar as Facebook's cookie banner does not allow users to refuse cookies with the same degree of simplicity as to accept them.
Regarding the update to facebook.com's cookie banner, as evidenced by Facebook to CNIL on 6 December 2021, CNIL noted that the content of the buttons of the first window had been modified from ""Manage data parameters"" and ""Accept all"" toÂ ""Other options"" and ""Allow all cookies"" respectively and that in the second window the former ""Allow cookies"" button is now called ""Allow only essential cookies", whilst an ""Allow all Cookies"" button has also been introduced alongside this button. However, CNIL emphasised thatÂ this update still does not put in place means making it possible to refuse cookies as easily as they can be accepted.
Outcomes
In view of the above, CNIL decided to impose a fine in the aforementioned amount against Facebook Ireland Limited, as well as an injunction ordering Facebook to modify, within three months, the methods of collecting the consent of users located in France to the use of cookiesÂ by offering them a means of refusal which is as simple as the mechanism provided for their acceptance, in order to guarantee their freedom of consent, and also providing thatÂ additional fines of â‚¬100,000 will be imposed per day of non-compliance following the end of such period.Â 
In addition, CNIL noted thatÂ though Facebook had requested that CNIL not make the decision public, the publication of this decision is justified having regard to the seriousness of the infringement in question, the scope of the processing, and the number of people concerned.

In particular, CNIL outlined that the fileÂ in questionÂ included information on the individuals'Â parent organisation, job title, professional address, professional landline number, mobile phone number, email address,Â and, in some cases, Twitter account.Â In addition, CNIL noted that a score ranging from 1 to 5 was assigned to each person, in order to assess their influence, credibility, and support for Monsanto on various subjects such as pesticides or genetically modified organisms.Â 
Notably, CNIL highlighted that the collection of such data and the creation of such filesÂ for lobbying purposes is not, in itself, illegal, but that individuals were nonethless entitled to be informed of theÂ existence of the file, in order to be able to exercise additional rights, in particular the right to object. Furthermore, CNIL found that the data collection activities had in fact been carried out by a vendor contracted by Monsanto,Â Fleishman-Hillard, and that Monsanto had also breached Article 28 of the GDPR by failing to include the provisions stipulated by the GDPR, notably in relation to data security, in its contracts withÂ Fleishman-Hillard.Â

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 31 December 2020, that it had fined PERFOMECLICÂ â‚¬7,300 for failure to demonstrate thatÂ validÂ consent of data subjects was obtained before sending prospecting emails in violation of the Postal and Electronic Communications Code ('CPCE') and theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('GDPR') following an investigation.Â In particular, CNIL highlighted that PERFOMECLICÂ is a very small company which sendsÂ commercial prospecting viaÂ email on behalf of advertisers and that the SignalÂ SpamÂ association, which receives reports from Internet users about unsolicited e-mails, hadÂ informed CNIL that PERFOMECLIC regularly appears at the top of the ranking of companies sending the most messages reported as 'spam'Â by internet users on French territory.
In addition, CNIL stipulated that PERFOMECLIC hadÂ breachedÂ the obligation to obtain the consent of personsÂ before sending prospecting emails, in violation of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE,Â as the company was not able to prove the existence of valid consent of the people surveyed. Moreover, CNIL stated that PERFOMECLIC was in breach of the principle of data minimisationÂ under Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, insofar as the company keeps data not necessary for sending electronic commercial prospecting, in this case the telephone number of prospects.Â CNIL further outlined that PERFOMECLIC had been inÂ breach of the obligation to properly inform peopleÂ under Article 14 of the GDPR, as well asÂ inÂ breach of the right toÂ object under Article 21 of the GDPR, as the company does not allow people contacted to effectively oppose the use of their data. Furthermore, CNIL stated that PERFOMECLIC had been in violation of Article 28 of the GDPR regardingÂ the contractual framework for relations with a subcontractorÂ due to the absence of mandatory clauses in the contract concluded between the company and its hosting provider.
Finally, CNIL stated that it hadÂ takenÂ into account the size and financial situation of the company to pronounce a dissuasive and proportionate fine and that it had also ordered the company to comply within two months or it will be finedÂ â‚¬1,000Â per day of delay.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') published, on 4 November 2021, a decision, issued on 29 October 2021, to fine the RATP Group,Â a state-owned public transport operator and maintainer headquartered in Paris, â‚¬400,000Â after noting that several bus centresÂ had included the number of days of strikes by workers in evaluation files, which were used to prepare promotion choices, in violation of the data minimisation principle under Article 5(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), among other violations. In particular, CNIL highlighted that files for evaluating performance and promotion prospects should only containÂ data necessary for the evaluation of workers, noting thatÂ the use of data relating to the number of days of strike action by agents was not necessary to achieve such purposes.Â 
In addition, CNIL found that RATP had also violated data retention and security obligations under Article 5(1)(e) andÂ Article 32 of the GDPR respectively.
In relation to the former, CNIL observed that RATP uses an application that allows the activity of workers to be monitored, through functionalities for viewing and extractingÂ data mainly from RATP's human resources information systems, and found that the RATP kept all of this data in the application's active database, accessible to a large number of workers, for a period that exceeds that necessary to accomplish the desired purposes.Â In addition, CNIL found that RATP alsoÂ kept employee evaluation files for more than threeÂ years, while their retention was only necessary 18 months.
In relation to data security,Â CNIL found that the RATP did not sufficiently differentiate the different levels of authorisation of workers. Specifically, CNIL outlinedÂ thatÂ the authorised workers were able to access all the categories of data contained in the tool without any distinction between the functions or objectives of such workers, and that workers also had access to the data relating to the workersÂ of all the other bus centres. Further to this finding, CNIL stated that such a configuration did not make it possible to prevent theÂ misuse of the data and therefore to guarantee its confidentiality.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 6 June 2019, that, followingÂ anÂ investigation, it had fined SERGIC SAS â‚¬400,000 for data security and data retention failures under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, CNIL found that a security defect on SERGIC's website allowed unauthorised third parties to access the personal data of rental candidates, including copies of identity cards, tax notices, marriage certificates and account statements. CNIL held that SERGIC had not complied with Article 32(1) of the GDPR as there was no prior authentication procedure in place to ensure the security of data processed.
In addition, CNIL found that SERGIC had stored the documents of unsuccessful rental candidates beyond the necessary time to achieve the purpose for which the data was collected and processed, which in this case, was for the purpose of allocating housing, and had breached the data limitation obligation under Article 5 of the GDPR. Finally, CNIL highlighted that in determining the amount of the fine under the maximum penalties of the GDPR, it took into account the seriousness of the breach, the lack of diligence in addressing the vulnerability, the nature of data made available, as well as SERGIC'sÂ diligence in subsequently addressing the vulnerability, and reduced the fine from â‚¬900,000, as initially proposed.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') published, on 30 December 2021, its decision No. 2021-020, as issued on 28 December 2021, to fine SlimPay SA â‚¬130,000 for violations of Articles 28(3), 32 and 34 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a data breach.Â 
Background to the decision
CNIL outlined that SlimPay, a payment institution which notably offers recurring payment solutions to its customers, had, in 2015,Â carried out an internal research project, during which it used the personal data contained in its databases. CNIL further outlined that when the research project ended in July 2016, the data remained stored on a server, which was not subject toÂ appropriate security measures and which was freely accessible on the internet. According to CNIL, it was not until February 2020 that SlimPay became aware of the data breach, which affected approximately 12 million people.
Findings of CNIL
In particular, CNIL identified that SlimPay had failed to implement security measures to protect the personal data which was accessibleÂ online fromÂ November 2015 and February 2020 and which included civil status data (title, last name, first name), postal and electronic addresses, telephone numbers, and banking information (BIC / IBAN) of more than 12 million people, thus violating Article 32 of the GDPR. CNIL further outlined that SlimPay's argument that none of the affected data was used fraudulently was no defence to the finding of an Article 32 violation.
In addition, CNIL found that some of the contracts concluded by the company SlimPayÂ with its service providers do not contain all the required clausesÂ to ensure that such subcontractors undertake to process personal data in accordance with the GDPR and indeed that some of the contracts do not even contain any of the required clauses, in violation of Article 28(3) of the GDPR.
Lastly, CNIL highlighted thatÂ given the nature of the personal data (including in particular banking information), the volume of persons concerned (more than 12 million), the possibility of identifying the persons affected by the violation from the data accessible,Â and the possible consequences for the persons concerned (risks of phishing or identity theft), the risk associated with the breach should be considered high and, as such,Â SlimPay should therefore have informed all affected data subjects, which it had failed to do, in violation of Article 34 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
In view of the above, CNIL decided to impose a fine against SlimPay in the aforementioned amount, and, consideringÂ the seriousness of the breaches committed, their persistence, and the number of affected data subjects, also decided to publish its decision.Â

In particular, CNIL outlined thatÂ SociÃ©tÃ© du Figaro had thus violated its obligation under Article 82 ofÂ Act No.78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties (as amended to implement the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)) to ensure cookie placement that is subject to user consent, emphasising thatÂ the fact that cookies come from third partiesÂ does not release the publisher from its own responsibility insofar as it has control of its site and its servers.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 30 June 2022, that it had issued, on 23 June 2022, Deliberation No. SAN-2022-011 of 23 June 2022, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬1 million against TotalEnergies ElectricitÃ© et Gaz France, for violations of Articles L. 34-5 of the Post and Electronic Communications Code (last amended in 2016) ('CPCE') and Articles 12, 14, 15, and 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the receipt of various complaints.
Background to the case
In particular, CNIL received complaints concerning issues with TotalEnergies facilitating data subject access requests and requests to object to the receipt of direct marketing communications. Accordingly, CNIL's Restricted Committee launched an investigation into the same.
Findings of CNIL
In light of the above, the deliberation determines that TotalEnergies did not provide users with the opportunity to object to the receipt of marketing communications via the online subscription form, in violation of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. Furthermore, CNIL found that TotalEnergies had not communicated vital information to data subjects relating to the processing of their personal data, thus violating Article 14 of the GDPR. Further to this, CNIL highlighted that TotalEnergies did not facilitate data subject access requests or requests exercising the right to object, which violates Articles 15 and 21 of the GDPR respectively. In addition, CNIL outlined that TotalEnergies had not responded to data subject requests within the one month timeframe, violating Article 12 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Consequently, CNIL imposed the aforementioned administrative fine against TotalEnergies and noted that the deliberation may be appealed before the Conseil d'Etat within two months of the date of notification of the same deliberation.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 21 November 2017, that it had issued a fine of â‚¬25,000 to WEB EDITIONS for security violations in breach of Articles 34, 8 and 9 of the Act No.78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties.Â 
In particular, CNIL had started an investigation following reports of a data security incident that made users' personal data freely accessible on the internet through four websites owned by WEB EDITIONS, which assist withÂ administrative procedures. It was found that by modifying the number in the URL address one could access other users' pages including identification data, email addresses, phone numbers, name of the parents when the application concerned a birth certificate and description of facts in the context of complaint filings. Although WEB EDITIONS, after being alerted by CNIL, took the necessary measures to put an end to the breach within three days, during an on-site inspection CNIL found that the incident had been caused by the failure to implement basic security measures when designing the website concerned.
In determining the amount of the penalty, CNIL also considered the sensitivity of the personal data processed on the one hand and the responsiveness and good cooperation showed by WEB EDITIONS on the other hand.

In particular, CNIL found that Carrefour France had, among other things, retained the data of more than 28 million inactive customers, through its customer loyalty programme, for an excessive period and in contravention of Article 5(1) of the GDPR, and failedÂ to sufficiently act upon customer requests to delete their data as well as customer objections to SMS and telemarketing, thereby breaching L34-5 of the Communications Code.Â In addition, CNIL noted that Carrefour France had not acted on its obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights by asking excessively for proof of identity for exercising said rights and by not complying with the time limits set out in Article 12 of the GDPR for responding to data subject rights.
Moreover, CNIL found that Carrefour France had failed to provide adequate information on data transfers and the legal basis of processing on its website and had not provided information in an easily comprehensible format, thus breaching Article 13 of the GDPR on the right to be informed. Moreover, CNIL held that Carrefour France breached Article 82 of the Act by automatically placing cookies on users' devices upon their access of the website, without first having obtained users' consent to the application of cookies.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 5 August 2020, its decision ('the Decision') issued on 28 July 2020 to impose a â‚¬250,000 fine on Spartoo SAS for violating multiple provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Decision outlines that Spartoo breached the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, retained the data for longer than was necessary under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, as well as failedÂ to abide by the obligation to inform under Article 13 of the GDPR, and to take adequate measures to ensure the security of data as required by Article 32 of the GDPR. More specifically, in light of the purposes of processing data for employee training and fraud prevention, CNIL considered that the permanent recording of telephone calls with customer service employees, the recording of customer bank details, and the collection of customers' health cards were excessive and, thus, contrary to data minimisation.
In addition, CNIL found that the Spartoo had not set up a retention period for customer and prospect data, and also did not regularly erase and archive personal data. Moreover, CNIL held that retaining, for a period exceeding five years, names and passwords in a non-anonymised form to enable customers to re-use their account contradicted Article 5(1)(e)Â of the GDPR. Moreover, CNIL held that customers were misinformed about the legal bases for the data processing and that employees had not been adequately informed about the purpose behind the processing, the recipients of the data, the data retention period, and their rights, which meant that Spartoo breached its obligation to provide information under Article 13 of the GPDR. Lastly, CNIL noted that Spartoo had not used adequately strong passwords for accessing customer accounts and, thus, failed to ensure the security of data processed by the company as required by Article 32 of the GDPR.
Therefore, CNIL, also taking into account the threeÂ million clients and 25 million prospects affected, as well as the retention of bank data, imposed a â‚¬250,000 fine on Spartoo and asked that it bringsÂ its processing in conformity with the GDPR within three months of the notification of the Decision.

In particular, CNIL highlighted that a contract can constitute a legal basis for processing provided that there is a contractual relationship between the controller and the concerned person or the processing is necessary to implement pre-contractual measures requested by the data subject and the contract is valid under the applicable law.
In addition, CNIL noted that the processing must be objectively necessary for the performance of the contract. CNIL indicated thatÂ the processing must not fulfil any purposes of the data controller, other than the performance of the contract, and as such that necessity should not be assessed based on the form of the contract, but instead on the basis of the objective pursued by the contract and the common agreement between the parties to the contract. Moreover, CNIL stated that if the contract ends or is breached, the data retained by the controller must subsequently be deleted on the basis of Article 17 of the GDPR.Â

In particular, CNIL stated that it will take a different approach for two types of obligations, namely fundamental principles, for which it will continue rigorous controls, and new obligations and rights, for which controls will initially be carried out in order to give organisations a good understanding of the operational implementation of the GDPR. In the latter case, where CNIL finds companies have shownÂ good faith, cooperationÂ and engagementÂ in a compliance process, the controls,Â in the first months, are not expected to result in sanctions.
Further, with regards to Data Protection Impact Assessments ('DPIAs'), CNIL will not require the immediate carrying out of DPIAs for processing activities that have been subject to a prior formality with CNIL before 25 May 2018, or that have already been registered. However, CNIL stated that, for high risk processing activities, a DPIA should be carried out 'within a reasonable time which can be estimated to be withinÂ three years from 25 May 2018.' Processing activities that have not been subject to prior formalities, that had undergone the required formalities with CNIL but have had a substantial transformation since then, as well as new processing activities taking place after 25 May 2018, will have to undergo a DPIA without delay.

'''The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 5 April 2022, that it had published a set of dedicated resources on artificial intelligence ('AI'). In particular, CNIL highlighted that the publication of the new resources arrives in the context of the wider European-level strategy on AI and is intended to contribute to the development ofÂ a robust regulatory framework for AI based on human rights and fundamental values, â€‹â€‹and thusÂ the building ofÂ the trustÂ of European citizens. Notably, the published content is directed at three distinct audiences: the general public; data controllers and processors; and AI specialists.Â 
In terms of guidance for data controllers and processors, CNIL notably published a guide on theÂ main principles of Act No.78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties and the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), to be followed in the implementation of personal data processing based on AI systems, as well as CNIL's positions on more specific issues, including on the establishment of a suitable legal basis for processing, data retention period determination, protecting against risks associated with AI models, ensuring transparency and explainability, and the facilitation of data subject rights, among several others. In addition, CNIL published a Self-Assessment Guide for AI Systems, which offers an analysis grid to allow organisations to assess for themselves the maturity of their AI systems with regard to the GDPR, with linked best practice guidance provided to facilitate and guide such assessments.

In particular, the Competition Authority outlined that Google had implemented two distinctÂ practices aimed at ensuring that its doubleclick for publishers ('DFP') advertising server favours its platform for selling advertising space ('SSP AdX') and, conversely, that its SSP AdX platform favours its DFP advertising server.
Furthermore, the Competition Authority outlined that these practicesÂ took place in a still-emerging market with strong growth and that they could affect the ability of competitors to develop in the market, stressingÂ that they have limited, in particular, the attractiveness of advertising servers and third-party platforms for the programmatic sale of advertising spaceÂ from a publisher's point of view, and have enabled Google to significantly increase its market share and its already very high revenues.
In addition to the financial penalty, the decision mandates Google to fulfil a number of commitmentsÂ to improve the interoperability of Google Ad Manager services with third-party advertising server and advertising space sales platform solutions and cease practices that favour Google.Â

'''The Office of the Personal Data Protection Inspector ('PDP') published, on 17Â AugustÂ 2021, a statement, in which it imposed a fine of GEL 1,000 (approx. â‚¬284), setting out its findingsÂ following an investigation into the lawfulness of the disclosure of the patient's health data onÂ social media by a doctor, in violation of theÂ Law of Georgia on Personal Data Protection of 28 December 2011 No. 5669Â ('the Data Protection Act').
Background to the statement
In particular, the PDP outlined in itsÂ statement that it had received a complaint from an individual and it had thus launched an investigation to examineÂ the lawfulness of the disclosure of the patient's health data onÂ social media by a doctor.Â 
Findings of the PDP
More specifically, the PDP found that:
The doctor had postedÂ photos of the patient before and after aÂ rhinoplasty procedure alongside text describing the health condition on his private social media accounts.Â Despite blurring the eyes of the patient on the photos, other facial features made it easy to identify the patient.
The patientÂ had initially givenÂ written consent to the publishing of theirÂ photos on social media, however, later, before the surgery, the patient subsequently withdrew consent.
The doctor could not provide a legal basis for disclosing photos and information revealing the patient'sÂ health data.
FollowingÂ the examination, the PDPÂ established that the doctor was not permittedÂ to post the mentioned information on social media by the medical institution, thus acted independently of the clinic conducting the medical procedures.
Outcomes
Given the above, the PDP found the doctor to be an administrative offender and imposedÂ an administrative fine of GEL 1,000 (approx. â‚¬284) for disclosure of patient'sÂ health data without a legal basis and for violating the principles laid down by the law when processing patient's data.

Hence, the PDP noted that the disclosure of the video recordings had no specific nor clearly defined legal purpose since the
Findings of the PDP
In particular, the PDP found that the Ministry and the medical institution had violated Article 5 of the LawÂ because they had viewed and downloaded the video recordings without a legal basis. In addition, the PDP stated that it imposed a fine of GEL 2,000 (approx. â‚¬570) to the Ministry for violations of Articles 43(2) (processing of data without a legal basis committed by a person who has been sentenced to an administrative penalty within one year for a violation of the same article) and 44(2) (violation of the principles of data processing committed by a person who has been sentenced to an administrative penalty within one year for a violation of the same article). Furthermore, the PDP stated that it imposed a fine of GEL 500 (approx. â‚¬140) to the medical institution for violations of Article 43(1) (processing of data without a legal basis), Article 44(1) (violation of the principles of data processing) and Article 46(1) (non-compliance with data protection requirements) of the Law.
Outcomes
The PDP imposed the aforementioned fine GEL 2,000Â (approx. â‚¬570) to the Ministry, for violations of Articles 43(2) and 44(2) of the Law and a fine of GEL 500Â (approx. â‚¬140) to a medical institution for violations of Articles 43(1), 44(1) and 46(1) of the Law.

Background to the decisionÂ 
In particular, the decision relates to Deutsche Bank's failures with regards to its obligations under the Benchmarks RegulationÂ as a contributor of data for the determination of benchmarks.
Findings of BaFinÂ 
Ultimately, BaFin found that as a supervised contributor for determining benchmarks, Deutsche Bank, at times, did not have in place effective preventative systems, controls, and policies to ensure the integrity and reliability of all contributions of input data, and therefore had been in breach of Article 16(2)(a) of the Benchmarks Regulation.Â

Background to the decision
In particular, the GRA stated that it was notified of the breach by the Police, in line with their obligations under Part III, Chapter 4, Section 76 of the DPA, which requires notification to the GRA where a personal data breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.
Furthermore, the GRA outlined thatÂ the Police had also notified data subjects as required by Part III, Chapter 4, Section 77 of the DPA, which provides that where a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the controller must inform the data subject of the breach without undue delay. However, the GRA also noted that the notification to data subjects hadÂ been carried out with unjustified delay.
Findings of the GRA
Thus, the GRA launched an investigation and found that, in respect of personal data processed for law enforcement purposes, the Police breached the following Sections of the DPA:

In particular, the decision provides that a car owner, after being informed about a fine imposed on them, exercised their right of access with Egnatia Odos, which is a company that operates a video surveillance system to detect non-payment of tolls, and requestedÂ to obtain visual material and a copy of the incident book, in connection with said infringement. In addition, the decision notes that Egnatia Odos initially said that it was unable to provide access to this information, and only proceeded with doing soÂ after the intervention of the HDPA, although visual material was not available due to a technical error.
Findings of the HDPA
Furthermore, the HDPA highlighted that the argument of Egnatia Odos that they could not provide access to this information, except where the HDPA or the prosecutor approved of it, and thereforeÂ was incompatible with Article 15 of the GDPR, further noting that Egnatia Odos had been informed by the HDPA of their obligations since 2017. As a result, the HDPA found that Egnatia Odos had violated Article 12(3) of the GDPR.Â In reaching this decision, the HDPA considered many factors, including Egnatia Odos's knowledge of their obligations and the fact that the data subject was not able to exercise their rights against the company.
Outcomes
As a result of the above violation, the HDPA issued a fine of â‚¬1,000 to Egnatia Odos.

'''The Hellenic Data Protection Authority ('HDPA') issued, on 9 March 2022, its decision No. 12/2022, in which it fined an unnamed employer â‚¬2,000, for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(2), and 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint by an employee.
Background to the decision
In particular, the decision provides that the complaint concerned a part-time employee at the employer's teaching institute who provided lessons via the ZOOM platform, which the employer attended, despite the employee's successive and explicit objections to such attendance, as well as interventions in the lessons. More specifically, the decision notes that the complainant rejected, in their complaint, the legal bases of consent and legitimate interests of the employer for the continuous monitoring of the complainant's lessons, and highlighted the principle of proportionality on which tele-monitoring should be based.
Findings of the HDPA
After assessment of the facts, the HDPA highlighted that, the existence of one legal basis under Article 6 of the GDPR does not relieve the data controller of their obligation to comply with Article 5(1) of the GDPR, and specifically with the principles of lawfulness, proportionality, and data minimisation. Furthermore, the HDPA added that, where one of the principles under Article 5(1) is violated, the processing in question is unlawful, and the assessment of the legal basis under Article 6 of the GDPRÂ unnecessary.
As such, the HDPA found that the employer violated Articles 5(1) and 5(2) of the GDPR because it proceeded to the processing of the complainant's personal data, despite the latter's request for objection to said processing, as well as Article 13 of the GDPR because of its failure to provide all information required under said article.
Outcomes
As a result, the HDPA issued a fine of â‚¬2,000 to the employer.

'''The Hellenic Data Protection Authority ('HDPA') published, on 15 February 2022, its decision No. 1/2021, in which it fined the Heraklion Port Authority A.E. ('H.P.A.') â‚¬30,000, for a violation of Articles 12(1), 12(2), and 15(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), as well as Article 13(1) of HDPA's Directive 1/2011 on the use of video surveillance systems for the protection of persons and property, following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the HDPA examined a complaint submitted by a car owner who was refused access to the content of material regarding a car accident which involved the complainant and another individual, that was recorded by the video surveillance system operated by the H.P.A. Specifically, the H.P.A. provided that the reason for not satisfying this right was because the complainant submitted the request 37 days after the incident, referring to Directive 1/2011, according to which 'no relevant data can be given after the lapse of 15 days'. Furthermore, theÂ H.P.A. claimed that the data had already been deleted by the time the access request was submitted.
Findings of the HDPA
Following the HDPA's investigation into the matter, it was found that the H.P.A. violated Article 15(1) of the GDPR, in combination with Article 12(1) and (2) of the GDPR because the H.P.A. should have responded to the access request, even with a negative response, informing the data subject that the images were deleted after six days after its collection. In addition to this, it was found that the H.P.A. had not deleted such data as claimed, but, instead, kept it, and as such, had no lawful reason for refusing to respond to the request. Furthermore, the HDPA highlighted that, following the application of the GDPR, the 15-day period under Directive 1/2011 was extended to 30 days, with the additional requirement for the data controller to keep the images for three months, if the incident concerns a third party.
In reaching this decision, the HDPA considered, among other things, the fact that H.P.A. failed to respond to the request although it knowingly kept such data in its system, and the fact that the H.P.A. failed to comply with the provisions of the GDPR since 25 May 2018, specifically with regards to the lawful operation of its video surveillance system, as it was found that 18 months after that, the H.P.A still had doubts about the lawful operation of the system and the retention of the images, which it kept indefinitely.
Outcomes
As a result, the HDPA fined the H.P.A. â‚¬30,000 for its failure to satisfy the access request.

In particular, the decision highlights that the HDPA, having considered all claims received, decided that the publication of the names of two former shareholders were not absolutely necessary in order to inform the public about the operation and future of transport in Thessaloniki. As a result of this violation, the decision notes that a fine of â‚¬3,000 was imposed on OASTH.

Findings of the HDPA
Furthermore, the HDPA's investigation revealed that a technical error in the application of One WayÂ led to phone calls to subscribers included in register 11, in violation of Article 11.1 of Law 3471/2006 on the Protection of Personal Data and Privacy in the Electronic Telecommunications Sector and Amendment of Law 2472/1997 ('the Telecommunications Law'). Specifically, the HDPA found that the error resulted from the lack of an automated exclusion process for subscribers who were included in the register 11 and an employee's omission to activate this process.
Additionally, the investigation further found that both the data controller (ZeniÎ˜) and the data processor (One Way) were responsible for the failure to implement technical and organisational security measures pursuant to Articles 28 and 32 of the GDPR, highlighting, however, that One Way was exclusively responsible for the special application through which register 11 subscribers were excluded from receiving calls, as well as the employee's omission.

Further to this, the HDPA outlined that it had invited PLUS REAL ADVERTISEMENT to submit its comments on the complaints and requested information on the general procedure that the same follows for carrying out telemarketing activities. In addition, the HDPA noted that one of the complaints was withdrawn by the complainant in the course of the investigation, as it had emerged that the complainant had indeed consented to the processing of personal data for the telemarking activities to which the phone call related.

Consequently, the HmbBfDI highlighted that data protection supervisory authorities, in Germany and in the EU, agree that effective consent can only be given if both alternatives, i.e. consent and rejection, are equally quickly and easily accessible. Thereafter, the HmbBfDI found that the rejection procedure for the processing of personal data by Google is significantly more complex than the procedure to provide consent.

KG â‚¬35.3 million for the unlawful monitoring of employees in the H&M service centre. In particular, theÂ HmbBfDI highlighted that H&M, which hasÂ its headquarters in Hamburg, runs a service centreÂ in NurembergÂ where, since at least 2014, extensive records of personal information on the living circumstancesÂ of some employees have been kept permanently. In addition, theÂ HmbBfDI noted that even after short absences of employees, team leads conducted 'Welcome Back Talks'Â in which, in several cases, concrete holiday experiences as well as diagnosis of diseases and symptoms were recorded. Furthermore, the HmbBfDI outlined that several supervisors acquired detailed knowledge about the private lives of their employees through individual talks and informal corridor talks, from harmless details to family problems and religious confessions.
Moreover, the HmbBfDI added that collected information was partly recorded, digitally stored, and accessible by up to 50 further managers, also noting that some of the records were kept with high amounts of detailÂ and organisedÂ chronologically, amountingÂ to a particularly intensive interference with the rights of the employees. Furthermore, theÂ HmbBfDI stated that the recorded personal information was used to assess the individual performance at work and to create profiles of employees that could be used with regards to measures and decisions affecting the employment relationship, alsoÂ stating that the data collection became known due to a configuration error that made records accessible across the company for twoÂ hours in October 2019.
Consequently, theÂ HmbBfDI stated that as a response to the violations, the company managementÂ presentedÂ a comprehensive conceptÂ on how data protection should be implemented at the Nuremberg office in the future, includingÂ a newly appointed data protection officer, and monthly data protection status updates.Â Finally,Â theÂ HmbBfDI detailed how company management had apologised to the affected data subjects and agreed toÂ pay the employees a considerable amount of damages, noting that H&M's response constitutes an unprecedented commitment to corporate responsibility after a data protection violation.Â

In addition, the HmbBfDI noted that a total of around 500,000 people had been affected. However, the HmbBfDI noted that the fine had been reduced significantly because Vattenfall had cooperated fully with the HmbBfDI in the process and stopped the non-transparent data comparison immediately after the HmbBfDI had taken action for the first time.

'''The Administrative Court of Wiesbaden ('the Court')Â announced, onÂ 14Â DecemberÂ 2021, its decision inÂ Case No. C-768/21, as issued on 10 December 2021, in which it had suspended proceedings and referred questions toÂ the Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU') for a preliminaryÂ ruling regarding interpretation of ArticlesÂ 57(1)(a), 58(2)(a) to (j), and 77(1) of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a claim raised by a data subject withÂ the Hessen data protection authority ('HBDI').
Background to the decision
In particular, the Court stated that the decision relates to a claim raised by a data subject demanding the HBDI
Moreover, the Court stated that theÂ submission by the data subjectÂ raised the question as to whether the decision by the HBDI is in itsÂ nature an official decision, meaning that judicial reviewÂ of a decision takenÂ by a supervisory authority in accordance with Article 78(1) of the GDPR leads to the decision being subject to a full substantive review by the Court, whereby, in individual cases the supervisory authority can also be obliged by the Court to issue a specific measure within the meaning of Article 58 of the GDPR.
Findings of the Court
Notably, the Court noted that it has doubts as to whether theÂ corrective powers conferred on the supervisory authority under Article 58(2) of the GDPR were intended to restore a lawful situation when data processing infringes citizen's rights, that Article 58(2) of the GDPR is to be understood as an obligation which establishes the citizen's right to official action where an undertaking or an authority has unlawfully processed the citizen's personal data or has infringed rights in some other way. In addition, the Court furtherÂ stated its doubts on whether ifÂ a personal data breach is established, the supervisory authority isÂ required to take corrective action and its discretion is limited to choosing which of the measures referred to in Article 58(2) of the GDPR it intends to issue.
Therefore, the CourtÂ stated that in light of the above considerations, it deems it necessary to refer questions to the CJEUÂ before it can make aÂ judgement on the current proceedings.Â In this regard, the Court specified that this is because the HBDIÂ exercised discretion in deciding whether or not to act in the present case and concluded that, although a personal data breach had occurred, no action was required under Article 58(2) of the GDPR, and further statedÂ thatÂ thisÂ approach would only be lawful if the supervisory authority is not required to take action under the GDPR whenever a personal data breach is established.
Outcomes
Ultimately, the court suspended the proceedings and decided to refer theÂ question to the CJEUÂ for a preliminary ruling on whether 'Articles 57(1)(a) and (f) and 58(2)(a) to (j) of the GDPR, read in combination with Article 77(1) of the same, to be understood as meaning that, where the supervisory authority finds that data processing has infringed the data subject's rights, the supervisory authority must always take action in accordance with Article 58(2) of the GDPR'.

'''The Third Civil Chamber of the FrankfurtÂ District Court published, on 28 June 2019,Â its decision ('the Decision') addressing the right of erasure under Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Decision outlines that the omission of the processing activity for the future has to be deemed part of the 'erasure' definition under Article 17(1) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the Decision highlights that this interpretation follows from Article 79(1) of the GDPR, which provides that each data subject shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy.
As a result, the Decision states that the plaintiff's request to delete a reportÂ published over 35 years beforeÂ concerning a potential but never prosecuted offence should prevailÂ over the search engine's interestÂ inÂ the publication of the report, particularly when a current public interest for the information no longer exists.

'''The Frankfurt Regional Court issued, on 19 October 2021, its judgment in 3-06 O 24/21, in which it imposed a fine to an unnamed company of â‚¬374 for saving cookies and web storage files without the consent of the claimant, thus violating Section 15(3) of the Telemedia Act of 26 February 2007Â ('TMG').
Background to the case
In particular, the Court found that when accessing the defendant's website the start page appeared for the claimant, but it was covered graphically behind a cookie banner with only the options 'accept' and 'further information'. Moreover, the Court stated that at the point in time in which the cookie banner was displayed to the claimant, the defendant had already saved several cookies and web storage files in the claimant's internet browser, and on their end device, without the claimant being able to click on the 'accept' button. Therefore, the Court established that the storage was carried out without the prior consent of the claimant.
Findings of the Court
More specifically, the Court held that the defendant is guilty of an unfair act according to Section 3(1) of the Law against Unfair Competition of 3 July 2004Â ('UWG'), since it violated a market behaviour regulation. Furthermore, the Court ruled that it is undisputed that the defendant had saved cookies and web storage files without the consent of the claimant and did not correctly indicate in the cookie settings that unnecessary cookies were deactivated, thus violating Section 15(3) of the TMG. Lastly, the Court detailed that the defendant is to be considered as a service provider according to Section 15 of the TMG, and is therefore responsible for their own information which they keep for use.
Outcomes
The Court decided that the claim of the plaintiff for reimbursement in the amount of â‚¬374,50 Â is justified, and therefore ordered the defendant to pay the aforementioned reimbursement and to bear the legal cost of the proceeding.Â

'''The National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information ('NAIH') issued, on 14 February 2022, itsÂ decision in Case No. NAIH-963-10/2022, in which it fined Techno-Tel TÃ¡vkÃ¶zlÃ©si Ã©s Informatikai, KivitelezÅ‘ Ã©s SzolgÃ¡ltatÃ³ Kft HUF 500,000 (approx. â‚¬1,350), for violations of Section 25/D(3)(a) of Act CXII of 2011 on the Right to Informational Self-determination and on the Freedom of Information, as amended by Act XXXVIII of 2018 (to implement the GDPR) ('the Act'), following an investigation into the operation of a public area surveillance system using facial recognition cameras in the administrative area of SiÃ³fok.
Background to the decision
In particular, the NAIH highlighted that it had decided to launch an investigation after having been informed via press reports that the Municipality of SiÃ³fok intended to install a 39-camera system with facial recognition artificial intelligence ('AI') to monitor the public space. Accordingly, the NAIH requested information from the Municipality on the details of its data management, as well as several documents. The NAIH further outlined that according to the response provided, a public domain camera system had been installed in SiÃ³fok since 2014, operated by the Municipality, with a cooperation agreement in place between the Municipality and the Police in the field of crime prevention and public safety, within the framework of which the Police had contributed to the development of the camera system, beginning in 2020, and for which Techno-Tel provided technical support for the management of recordings. In thisÂ context, the Municipality sent out a call for tenders, on 18 April 2021, following which it concluded a purchase contract with Techno-Tel, on the basis of which old cameras were dismantled in May 2021, and new cameras installed in June 2021.
Findings of the NAIH
In particular, the NAIH found, despite the Municipality's claims that the use of the surveillance was justified because thousands of people visit nightclubs in the affected area, which results in an increase in crime, this was not sufficient to justify the mass processing of biometric data under Section 7(3) of Act LXII of 1999 on Public Area Surveillance and Section 42(2) of Act XXXIV of 1994 on the Police, which provide for the possibility of public domain surveillance and taking photos in the public domain,Â since biometric dataÂ is subject to special protection as special category data. Therefore, the NAIH found that the current legislation does not allow for the operation of a public area surveillance system in Hungary that processes biometric data.
The NAIH further identified shortcomings in the cooperation agreement between the Police and the Municipality, noting that the same did not provide for a public area camera system. Additionally, the NAIH found that the Police and the Municipality were joint controllers for the data processing in question, and identified a violation on the part of each such joint controller in relation to the absence of a data processing agreement pursuant to Section 25/B(1) of the Act, which regulates the tasks and responsibilities related to the performance of the controller's obligations.
Furthermore, the NAIH found that the conditions of physical security in the operator's room and the server room at the premises of the Police and the Municipality did not provide adequate data security, as well as finding a breach of Article 25/F(1)(d) of the Act in relation to the fact that the public area supervisors log in to the system with the same login details, in terms of accountability and data security.
In addition, the NAIH found that the obligation under Article 25/F(4) of the Act to keep data recorded in the register of controllers and processors in an electronic logbook for tenÂ years after deletion of the processed data could not be fulfilled, since the activities of users can be viewed in the system for 30 days.
Finally, the NAIH identified Techno-Tel as a data processor for the processing in question and found that it had modified, deleted, and createdÂ access roles in the surveillance processing system unbeknownst to the Municipality, thereby infringing Article 25/D(3)(a) of the Act, which provides that a data processor may only act on the written instructions of the controller.
Outcomes
In consideration of the above findings, the NAIH found that the Municipality and the Police had processed personal data unlawfully through the camera surveillance system. In relation to Techno-Tel, taking into account, on the one hand, among other mitigating factors, that the modification, deletion, and creation of new roles in the system were carried out by three employees without any instruction from Techno-Tel, and on the other hand, among other aggravating factors, that such act took place after Techno-Tel had already become aware of the NAIH's investigation into the surveillance system, the NAIH decided to impose the aforementioned fine.

In particular, the NAIH detailed that it had initiated procedures according to a complaint received in which a bank rejected the complainant's loan application, and later based on the personal data recorded in connection with the rejected loan application sent another notification of the result of a credit assessment, despite the fact that the complainant did not request another loan offer.
Findings of the NAIH
Following its investigation, the NAIH found that the bank violated Article 5(2) of the GDPR, as it indicated an inappropriate legal basis, and was therefore unable to prove the conditions for the legality of data processing. Further to this, the NAIH explained that the bank did not carry out a genuine assessment of interests, and therefore did not prove a legal basis in relation to the data processing and soÂ the data processing conflicted with Article 6(1) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the NAIH explained thatÂ the information provided to the complainantÂ hadÂ serious deficiency in terms of the pre-assessment and didÂ not allow customers to see the process of data management and how their data would be processed, thus violating Article 12(1)Â of the GDPR.Â

In particular, the NAIH noted that it had considered the BRFK's failure to report the incident within 72 hours, as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), an aggravating factor, which warranted the fine, even though the police officer who misplaced the USB flash drive later found it in his car.

'''The National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of InformationÂ ('NAIH') issued, on 27 October 2021, a decision in which it fined an unnamed car importer HUF 5,000,000Â (approx. â‚¬13,590) for data processing in the absence of a suitable legal basis and without complying with the requisite transparency obligations in relation to a customer satisfaction survey, in violation of ArticlesÂ 5(1)(a),Â (c),Â (2),Â 6(1), 12(1), and 13Â of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint lodged to the NAIHÂ by a customerÂ of one of the car importer'sÂ vehicle repair shops.
Background to the case
In particular, the NAIH outlined that it had received a complaint from the customerÂ on 23 February 2021 stating that, after having had their vehicle serviced, the customerÂ wasÂ asked to provide the car importer with their email address, and subsequentlyÂ received an unsolicited email from the car importerÂ requesting that they respond to a customer satisfaction survey, which included information which the customer had not expressly provided, such as their vehicle identification number.
Findings of the NAIH
More specifically, the NAIH found that,Â though the customer had conceded that they had been informed orally that they were not required to provide their email address, the car importerÂ did not sufficiently inform theÂ customer to enable the exercise of their data subject rights in an informed manner,Â i.e. knowing precisely what their email address would be used for, and what other personal data would be affected, therefore violating Articles 12(1) and 13 of the GDPR. Notably, the NAIH cited Article 5(2) of the GDPR, which explicitly places the burden of proof on the data controller as to whether the data subject has been adequately informed.
With respect to the legal basis for processing, the NAIH noted that the car importer had argued that it had a legitimate interest in checking that its Hungarian dealership and service partners meet the expected quality standards. Though acknowledging that this in itself wasÂ not an unlawful interest, the NAIH emphasised that the identification of a lawful basis is only the first step in establishing a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, and other safeguards must be ensured in order to lawfully rely on this legal basis. Specifically, the NAIH highlighted that in the absence of appropriate safeguards, the risk of the data subject's rights being infringed wasÂ such that the required balancing of interests can only result in the legitimate interests of the controller or third party being overriden by the data subject's rights due to the risks inherent in the processing. Applying this rationale to the present case, the NAIH found that in the absence of adequate information and, consequently, of the ability to exercise data subject rights, the legal basis of legitimate interestÂ could not be relied upon by the car importer, irrespective of other considerations, thus constituting a violation of Articles 5(1)(a) and 6(1) of the GDPR.
In relation to the inclusion of the vehicle identification number in the email, the NAIH contested the car importer's arguments that this was necessary for the purpose of the customer identifying the vehicle which had been serviced, noting, among other considerations, that the customer would already know if they had taken their car to a garage recently. Thus, in addition to the NAIH's findings around legal basis and transparency, it found that the car importerÂ had also violated the data minimisation principle under Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR.
Outcomes
In view of the foregoing, as well asÂ several mitigating and aggravating factors, including, on the one hand, the market weight of the car importer, the number of potential stakeholders affected, and thatÂ the infringement was the result of a long-standing and continuous practice over several years, and, on the other, that this is the first identified data protection infringementÂ by the car importer,Â the NAIH decided to impose a fine on the car importerÂ in the aforementioned amount.

Findings of the NAIH
Following its investigation, the NAIH found that the company violated Article 6(1) of the GDPR, noting that the legal basis of consent, which the company purported to rely on, could not be regarded as a valid legal basis for the data processing as the company was unable to demonstrate that the data subjects consented to the processing of their personal data. In regard to Article 5(1)(a) and (b), the NAIH clarified that information was not collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes as the company did not provide information confirming their purpose of processing, and the provided documents and statements did not prove the existence of their objective.
In addition to the above, the NAIH explained that the company's information sheet did not contain the additional important information necessary to ensure fair and transparent data management, noting that the information tangentially mentioned the possibility of blocking personal data and data in the address register if the data subject did not wish to receive similar inquiries. In addition, the NAIH explained that the company also did not provide data subjects with information on the right to submit a complaint to the supervisory authority as outlined in Article 14(2)(e) of the GDPR.

Background to the decision

Findings of the case
As part of its investigation, the NAIH determined that the company had infringed Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(b), 6(a), and 9(1) of the GDPR. Further, the NAIH outlined that the company transferred the applicant's criminal personal data on two occasions to individuals who were presumed to know the applicant's contact details, even though it would have been sufficient for one individual to receive the same in order to achieve the stated purpose. In sending the e-mail address of the applicant to an unnamed third party, the NAIH found the company to have disclosed the applicant's criminal personal data to a large number of employees.
In its decision to impose a fine, the NAIH found the violations to be serious, considering, among other things, that criminal personal data constitutes special personal data under the GDPR.

Background to the decision
In particular, the NAIH reported that, according to the complaint, the complainant had repeatedly requested the deletion of their personal data (name, address, and telephone number) from the defendant's online directory, however such requests had not been fulfilled. In light of this, the NAIH outlined that the complainant had requested NAIH to order the defendant to delete their personal data.
Findings of the NAIH
Further to the above, at the end of the investigations carried out, the NAIH found that the complainant's requests had not been correctly registered in the defendant's system due to technical and clerical errors, causing the request to remain unfulfilled. However, the NAIH found that the defendant had eventually proceeded with the erasure of the complainant's personal data. Therefore, the NAIH partially dismissed the complaint but found that the defendant had violated Article 12(2) of the GDPRÂ by failing to facilitate the complainant's right to erasure.
Moreover, the NAIH determined that the defendant had disclosed the personal data of the complainant in the online directory without obtaining their consent, thus breaching Article 6(1) of the GDPR. In this regard, the NAIH also found that NAIH had, in any case, failed to demonstrate that the complainant had indeed consented to the disclosure, infringing the principle of accountability.
Based on the established facts, the NAIH considered it justified to impose an administrative fine and, in quantifying the same, it took into account, among other things, the fact that the failure to satisfy the complainant's requests had been caused by gross negligence.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the NAIH imposed the aforementioned fine, to be paid within 30 days, and that the defendant may lodge an appeal before the competent judicial authority within the same timeframe.

'''The Icelandic data protection authority ('PersÃ³nuvernd') published, on 20 December 2021, its decision in Case No. 2021040879, as issued on 16 December 2021, in which it found the City of ReykjavÃ­k in violation of Articles 8(1)(1), 8(1)(2), 8(1)(3), 8(1)(5), 8(1)(6), 17(1), 23, 24, 25(3), 25(1), 27(1), and 29(1) of the Act on Data Protection and the Processing of Personal Data No. 90/2018 ('the Act') and Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(b), 5(1)(c), 5(1)(e), 5(2), 8(2), 13, 25(1), 25(2), 26(1)(2), 28, 28(3), 32, 35(1), and 46 of General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following its failure to comply with data protection obligations in processing sensitive personal data of children.
Background to the decision
In particular, the PersÃ³nuvernd launched, in April 2020, an investigation following a suggestion that one of the City of ReykjavÃ­k's primary schools had, earlier that month, requested parental consent for the use of the Seesaw Learning, Inc. student system in teaching. Moreover, the PersÃ³nuvernd highlighted that the investigation was initated to determine whether the processing of personal information, which involves the use of the student system by the City of ReykjavÃ­k, is in accordance with Act and the GDPR.
The PersÃ³nuvernd outlined that In light of this, it investigated the processing of personal information in the Seesaw student system, notably the production agreement with Seesaw concerned processing of location data and sensitive personal data, purpose and consent of the processing of personal information, the scope of processing, fairness, proportionality, minimisation of data, education for parents and guardians, assessment of risks and effects on privacy, and appropriate security measures.
Findings of the PersÃ³nuvernd
Further to the above, the PersÃ³nuvernd stated that they considered the processing of personal information of school children in the Seesaw student system on behalf of the City of ReykjavÃ­k was not in accordance with the Act and the GDPR for the reasons stated below.
The PersÃ³nuvernd noted that they found that there was a violation of Data Protection by Design and Default in failing to obtain data for legitimate purposes pursuant to Articles 8(1)(2), 8(1)(3), and 8(1)(5) of the Act and Articles 5(1)(b), 5(1)(c), and 5(1)(e) of the GDPR. The PersÃ³nuvernd specified that in addition, it found that it was possible to identify registered persons for longer than necessary which violated Article 25(1) and Article 25(2) of the GDPR.
Moreover, the PersÃ³nuvernd deemed that the City of ReykjavÃ­k failed to process personal data in a fair and transparent manner, noting that Seesaw processed the personal data of parents and guardians of students in order to direct them to marketing, and, as a result, violated Article 8(1)(1) of the Act and Articles 5 and 13 of the GDPR. In particular, PersÃ³nuvernd found that the City of ReykjavÃ­k did not base the processing of personal information in the system on a satisfactory authorisation such as consent, pursuant to Article 9 of the Act and Article 6(1) of the GDPR.
Furthermore, the PersÃ³nuvernd considered that the City of ReykjavÃ­k did not enter into a satisfactory production agreement pursuant to Articles 23 and 25(3) of the Act and Articles 26(1), 26(2), and 28(3) of the GDPR. The PersÃ³nuvernd noted that in particular, the authority noted the failure to clarify which of the parties was responsible for the processing of data and that the existing processing agreement was not accessible to the registered person in Iceland pursuant to Article 8(1)(1) of the Act and Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR.
The PersÃ³nuvernd also found that the City of ReykjavÃ­k violated Article 29(1) of the Act and Article 35(1) of the GDPR for failing to complete the DPIA before beginning to process data. Â 
The PersÃ³nuvernd held that the City of ReykjavÃ­k failed to demonstrate that it had fulfilled its responsibilities relating to ensuring the security of the processing of personal information in the Seesaw student system pursuant to Articles 8(1)(6), 24, 25(1), 27(1) of the Act and Articles 5(1)(f), 28(1) and 32(1) of the GDPR.
Finally, in its investigation, the PersÃ³nuvernd noted that the personal information of students in the system was transferred to the US and processed there. The decision added that the City of ReykjavÃ­k formally requested for the information to be processed only within Europe, but, if this does not happen, it will be requested that the contract with Seesaw be terminated and the processing of personal information in the student system stopped. The PersÃ³nuvernd highlighted that the company's Standard Contractual Clauses did not provide adequate protection and did not ensure secure transfer in pursuant to Article 46 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
The PersÃ³nuvernd set out that the City of ReykjavÃ­k was ordered to close the accounts of school children in Seesaw and ensure that all their personal information is deleted from the system, but not before a copy of the information had been taken to hand over to the children or for safekeeping in schools. The PersÃ³nuvernd highlighted that the children's privacy protection will not be guaranteed in any other way and evidence that these instructions have been complied with must be received no later than 20 January 2022.
Moreover, the PersÃ³nuvernd disclosed that there were discussions on the possibility of a fine in accordance with Articles 46(2)(1), 46(1), 46(2), and 46(3) of the Act and with the GDPR. However, the municipality will be granted a special right to object in this regard.
Finally, the PersÃ³nuvernd provided additional guidance in its decision for municipalities using information technology systems to process children's personal information.

'''The Icelandic data protection authorityÂ ('PersÃ³nuvernd') published, on 23 February 2022, its decision in Case No. 2020051690, as issued on 10 February 2022, in which it found Eimskip Ãsland ehf. to be in violationÂ of ArticlesÂ 8(1)(3), 17, and 24 of the Act 90/2018 on Privacy and Processing of Personal Data ('the Act') and Articles 5(1)(c), 14, andÂ 25 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following submission of aÂ complaint regarding unlawful processing of personal data by EimskipÂ and its subsidiary Faroe Ship P/F.
Background to the case
In particular, the PersÃ³nuvernd outlined that the complaint pertained toÂ the payment of benefits due to loss of employment, and the information concerned was collected from the Directorate of Labour, the Director of Internal Revenue, and other relevant partiesÂ relying on the power of attorney to obtain all necessary information.Â 
Findings of the PersÃ³nuvernd
In light of the above, the PersÃ³nuvernd found that processing of personal information by Eimskip was necessary to fulfil the provisions of the employment contract and thus, in accordance with Article 9(2) of the Act and Article 6(1) of the GDPR.
Moreover, in its investigation, the PersÃ³nuvernd outlined that for the purpose of lawful, fair and transparent processing, Eimskip should have ensured that it be clear to the data subject when their personal dataÂ is collected or used, to what extent it is or will be processed, and for what purpose it will be processed in accordance with Article 8(1)(1) of the Act and Article 5(1) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the PersÃ³nuvernd clarifyiedÂ thatÂ compliance with this provision could be achieved through adopting special measures relating to education for registered individuals, and in such education, it must be borne in mind that the knowledge of the data subjects is a prerequisite for them to be able to protect their rights under privacy law as provided under Articles 14 of the GDPR and Article 17 of the Act. Therefore, the PersÃ³nuvernd found that Eimskip had violated Articles 14 of the GDPR and Article 17 of the Act where it did not inform the complainant about what data was processed and who was responsible for the processing.
In addition, the PersÃ³nuvernd determined that the processing of information was notÂ sufficient, relevant and in excess of what was necessary to perform the provisions of the employment contract, andÂ Eimskip had processed information beyond what was necessary in accordance with Articles 8(1) and 8(3) of the Act and Articles 5(1)(a) and (c) of the GDPR. Therefore, Eimskip had failed to adopt appropriate organisational and technical measures to comply with the above principles in accordance with Article 24(1) of the Act and Article 25(1) of the GDPR. Additionally, Eimskip had failed to take appropriate measures to ensure that only personal information necessary for the purpose of the processing is processed at any given time, and this applies, among other things, to how much personal information is collected in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Act and Article 25(2) of the GDPR.
With regards to the collection of all necessary information from the above-mentioned bodies,Â the PersÃ³nuvernd concluded that there was no need for such a broad mandate as it was only necessary to obtain information from the Directorate of Labour regarding the purpose of payments, in accordance with the provisions of the employment contract. Therefore, the PersÃ³nuvernd highlighted thatÂ Eimskip had obtained information in excess of that which was necessary for the payments,Â thusÂ violatingÂ Article 8(1)(3) of the Act and Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Ultimately, the PersÃ³nuvernd determined that Eimskip's processing ofÂ personal information of the complainant, as obtained through power of attorney from the said bodies, was excessive and thus in violation of Articles 8(1)(3), 17, and 24 of the Act, as well as 5(1)(c), 14, andÂ 25 of the GDPR.

'''The Icelandic data protection authority ('PersÃ³nuvernd') published, on 12 January 2022, its decision in Case No. 2020092451, issued on 17 December 2021, in which it found Landsbankinn hf. in violation of Articles 8(1)(1), 8(1)(6), 9, 23, 24, and 27 of the Act 90/2018 on Privacy and Processing of Personal Data ('the Act'), and Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(f), 6, 24, 25, and 32 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ('GDPR'), following a complaint of unauthorised access to the complainant's bank account.
Background to the case
In particular, the PersÃ³nuvernd noted that it had invited Landsbankinn to submit explanations on 4 May 2021, following a complaint made on 24 September 2020Â by the complainant that their father had access to their online banking from the age of 18 to 27 without consent or power of attorney.
Findings of the PersÃ³nuvernd
In light of the above, the PersÃ³nuvernd considered that although the father should have informed the data subject of his access to their bank accounts and requested their consent for continued access after turning 18 years old, it was in factÂ Landsbankinn's responsibility to ensure that the father did have authorised access or the data subject's consent after turning 18. As a result, the PersÃ³nuvernd determined that no authorisation was given for the processing, which wasÂ thus in violation of Article 9 of the Act and Article 6 of the GDPR.
In addition, the PersÃ³nuvernd found that Landsbankinn's arrangement to not abolish the access rights of custodians when the owners of the accounts become of legal age violated Articles 8(1)(1), 8(1)(6), 23, 24, and 27 of the Act and Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(f), 24, 25, and 32 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Consequently, the PersÃ³nuvernd determined that Landsbankinn had violated their obligations, but had not issued any measures or instructions for improvements as the bank had already adopted arrangements and measures for granting access rights to accounts.

'''The Icelandic data protection authority ('PersÃ³nuvernd') published, on 16 March 2022, its decision in Case No. 2020112830, as issued on 8 MarchÂ 2022, in which it found ReykjavÃ­k University to be in violation ofÂ Articles 8(1)(1) and 17 of the Act 90/2018 on Privacy and Processing of Personal Data ('the Act') and Articles 5(1)(a) and 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following submission of a complaint regarding unlawful processing of personal data through electronic monitoring.Â 
Background to the case
In particular, the PersÃ³nuvernd outlined that the complainant argued that the University unlawfully processed its personal information for electronic monitoring collected through audio and video recording during the sitting of a remote examination.
Findings of the PersÃ³nuvernd
In light of the above, the PersÃ³nuvernd found that the University's processing of personal information was necessary to prevent examination fraud, to ensure security and reliability of exam results and thatÂ this was enough to be deemed as a legitimate interest in accordance with Article 9(6) of the Act and Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. In addition, the PersÃ³nuvernd found that the University had taken the adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of personal information collected during the processing, which was only pursued following an Impact Assessment which considered the IP address, the implications of the cloud technology of Zoom, and the retention of the recordings. Therefore, the PersÃ³nuvernd was satisfied that the University had sufficiently ensuredÂ that personal data was processed in a secure manner in accordance with Articles 5(1)(f) of the GDPR and Article 8(1)(6) of the Act. Furthermore, the PersÃ³nuvernd noted that the University had offered the complainant the alternative to sit the exam at the University avoiding the electronic monitoring, but this was rejected by the complainant and that, therefore, they had provided students with right to object and the modalities for the exercise of their rights, thus meeting the obligations of Articles 12 and 21 of the GDPR and Article 21 of the Act.
However, the PersÃ³nuvernd noted that while the University had provided the students with instructions on the electronic monitoring, this was not enough to inform or educate the data subjects about the processing and their rights in connection to it.Â Specifically, theÂ PersÃ³nuvernd detailed thatÂ the instructions didÂ not discuss the configuration of the system that gives the host a single option to record the meeting or the legal authority on which the processing is based, nor did they specify how it will ensure the security of student's personal data,Â the right to access their personal information, theÂ students' right to object to the processing, or the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. Therefore, the PersÃ³nuvernd outlined that the University failed to fulfil its duty to inform and thus failed to ensure that data was processed in a lawful, fair, and transparent manner in accordance with Articles 5(1)(a) and 13 of the GDPR and Articles 8(1)(1) and 17 of the Act.
Outcomes
Ultimately, the PersÃ³nuvernd concluded that the University's processing of personal information about the complainant did not comply with the provisions of the Act and the GDPR on the obligation to provide information and the principle of transparency. Finally, theÂ PersÃ³nuverndÂ ordered the University to provide their students, no later than 8 April 2022, with an instruction on the processing of their personal information that may take place in connection with electronic monitoring duringÂ remote examinations.

Background to the decision
In particular, the PersÃ³nuvernd issued in December 2021Â its 
Therefore, in this particular decision,Â the PersÃ³nuvernd considered whether it should impose a fine and how much this should be,Â following its findings that the City of ReykjavÃ­k's violations concerned the personal data of children who enjoy special protection under the Act.
Findings of the PersÃ³nuvernd
Further to the above, the PersÃ³nuvernd considered that it wasÂ likely that their sensitive personal information was entered into the system as teacher feedback and information on students' private affairs in violation of Article 5 of the GDPR. Moreover, theÂ PersÃ³nuvernd noted that the purpose of the processing was not sufficiently defined and thus the processing authorisation was void in accordance with Articles 6 and 28 of the GDPR. In addition, theÂ PersÃ³nuvernd indicated thatÂ the principle of proportionality and data minimisationÂ was not observed in accordance with Articles 5(1)(b) and (c) of the GDPR, and that there was a high risk of personal data being transferred to the United States and processed without adequate protection in violation of Articles 32, 35(1), and 46 of the GDPR.Â However, the PersÃ³nuvernd did acknowledge that no damage appeared to have been caused by the violations, the City of ReykjavÃ­k responded to the PersÃ³nuvernd's messages in the handling of the case in a clear and concise manner, and the city stopped supporting processing in the student system following its recommendations.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the PersÃ³nuvernd decided to impose a fine of ISK 5 million (approx. â‚¬35,840)Â on the City of ReykjavÃ­k, payableÂ to the Treasury within one month from the date of this decision.

'''The Icelandic data protection authority ('PersÃ³nuvernd') published, on 10 May 2022, its decision in Case No. 2020051610, as issued on 3 May 2022, in which it imposed a fine of ISK 1.5 million (approx. â‚¬10,770) to HEI - Medical Travel ehf, for violations of Articles 9(1) and 17(2) of Act 90/2018 on Privacy and Processing of Personal Data ('the Act') and Articles 15(1) and 15(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint.
Background to the decision
In particular, the PersÃ³nuvernd recalled that it had received a complaint from an individual alleging that HEI had not processed their request for access to their personal information. More specifically, the PersÃ³nuvernd highlighted that the complaint had been initiated when HEI had sent an unsolicited email to the individual, prompting the individual to request information from HEI regarding the collection, registration, and storage of their email address.
In this regard, the PersÃ³nuvernd noted that, according to HEI's statement, the individual's email address had been registered and obtained by an unauthorised employee, a breach which had been reported to the PersÃ³nuvernd on 30 January 2020. Furthermore, the PersÃ³nuvernd noted that HEI had claimed that the email had been sent by mistake and that it had not instructed the employee to send the same.
Findings of the PersÃ³nuvernd
Accordingly, the PersÃ³nuvernd concluded that given that the individual's email address had been obtained by an unauthorised employee, there was no authorisation for the processing of the individual's personal information, thereby violating Article 9(1) of the Act. Furthermore, the PersÃ³nuvernd determined that it is undisputed that HEI had not provided the individual with access to their personal information and that HEI had in fact deleted the individual's email address upon receiving such request. In addition, the PersÃ³nuvernd indicated that it is also clear that HEI did not inform the individual on how their information had been obtained, in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR.
In calculating the fine, the PersÃ³nuvernd took into account various mitigating and aggravating factors, such as the number of individuals affected by the same situation and the fact that it is unclear whether the individual's email address had been lawfully obtained.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PersÃ³nuvernd imposed a fine of ISK 1.5 million (approx. â‚¬10,770) on HEI, which shall be paid within one month from the date of ruling.

'''TheÂ Icelandic data protection authorityÂ ('PersÃ³nuvernd') announced, on 29 June 2021, that it had issued a decision to fineÂ HuppuÃ­s ehf.Â ISK 5 millionÂ (approx. â‚¬34,000) for unlawful video surveillance of its employees, in violation ofÂ Articles 6(1)(a) and (c), Article 5(1), 12(1) and (2) and 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, PersÃ³nuvernd outlined that following a complaint from one of the company's underage employees concerningÂ constant video surveillance in the area that employees changed clothes, it hadÂ foundÂ that HuppuÃ­s had five CCTV cameras installed for security purposes and that the employees did not have access to an acceptable area to change clothes that was not under surveillance. In addition,Â PersÃ³nuvernd highlighted thatÂ labels and signs indicating the video surveillanceÂ were insufficient both in the employees'Â areas as well as in the customer service area.
Therefore, PersÃ³nuvernd concluded that the complainant's personal data was not processed lawfully, fairly, or in a transparent manner, nor was it adequate, relevant, and limited to what was necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data was processed, whilst also highlighting thatÂ the company had failed to inform its employees about the personal data collected via video surveillance and their rights in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR.
Among the several identified aggravating factors influencing the fine amount, PersÃ³nuvernd notedÂ that the the data subjects affected by the infringements, including the complainant, were in many cases underage employees whose personal data benefits from specific protection under the GDPR. Furthermore,Â PersÃ³nuvernd outlined that, in addition to the financial penalty,Â HuppuÃ­s was instructed to stop the video surveillance of the employee area and delete all recordings from that camera, as welll as to update and implement procedures to ensure thatÂ employees receive sufficient information on the video surveillanceÂ and their rights regarding it.

In particular,Â PersÃ³nuvernd outlined that through the company's platform data security flaws meant that the personal data of students could be accessed simply by editing numbers in the relevant URL. Furthermore,Â PersÃ³nuvernd highlighted that a solution to fix the security flaw had previously been identified by InfoMentor, but through human error the company had failed to correct the flaw despite receiving instructions from a network security companyÂ to do so. Thus,Â PersÃ³nuvernd consideredÂ that the security breach could have been prevented through adequate follow-up and testing of security measures.
In light of the above,Â PersÃ³nuvernd concluded that InfoMentor had failed to implement sufficient technical and organisational measures toÂ ensure the security of the students' data, and had furthermore failed to protect theÂ integrity and confidentiality of such data, in violation of Article 5(1)(f) and 32 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').Â

Background to the decision
In particular, the PersÃ³nuvernd reported that, as a measure to boostÂ the tourism sector, the Ministry had contracted Yay in 2020 for the issuance of digital gift certificates, for all individuals over 18 years old domiciled in Iceland, through an already existing app developed by Yay. Further to this, the PersÃ³nuvernd stated that it had received numerous complaints by data subjects concerning the fact that the use of the digital gift certificates required extensive personal information andÂ access to users' telephones. As such,Â an investigation was launched.
Findings of the PersÃ³nuvernd
Further to the above, the PersÃ³nuvernd considered that, due to the economic situation, a heavy emphasis was placed on the speed of both the programming and the publication of the app, which resulted in unlawful and unnecessary collection of considerable amounts of personal data and the collection of access rights to the user'sÂ mobile devices. Additionally, the PersÃ³nuvernd found that requirements for consent were not met and the information the data subjects received when signing into the app was inadequate. Moreover, the PersÃ³nuvernd held that a valid processing agreement was not set up between the Ministry (as data controller) and Yay (as data processor) and that the same failed to comply with the principles of Data Protection by Design and by Default, which, in turn, would have also ensured compliance with the principle of data minimisation at the time of designing the app. Furthermore, the PersÃ³nuvernd outlined that the Ministry and Yay had not ensured an appropriate level of security of personal data.
In determining the amount of the sanctions, the PersÃ³nuvernd took into account, among other things, the nature and scope of the processing as well as the multiple infringements of the GDPR as aggravating circumstances. Additionally, inÂ considering the sanction, theÂ PersÃ³nuverndÂ noted that it took into account that the Ministry and Yay, after the launch of the investigation by PersÃ³nuvernd, had updatedÂ their procedures, set up a valid processing agreement, and provided data subjects with information on the data processing.
Outcomes
Further to the above, the PersÃ³nuvernd issued the abovementioned fines and ordered that payment be received within two months from the date of the decision. Lastly, the PersÃ³nuvernd required the Ministry and Yay to ensure that before users register to the app, they receive the necessary information. However, in light of the fact that many of the shortcomings had been rectified,Â the PersÃ³nuvernd did not consider necessary to issue further instructions.

In particular, PersÃ³nuvernd highlighted that the breach occurred when a former employee of the SAA received boxes containing what were supposed to be personal belongings that he had left there.

'''Please note that the comparison is based on our general review of the GDPR. Our comparison will be based on and limited only to the following specific key points that are changed or newly introduced in the PDP Bill, namely: (i) consent; (ii) controller and processor; and (iii) data protection officers ('DPOs').
Under the GDPR, consent is defined as any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.
In relation to consent, the GDPR provides that processing personal data is generally prohibited, unless it is expressly permitted by law, or the data subject has consented to the processing. Under the GDPR, consent is only one of six bases mentioned in the GDPR. The others are related to contracts, legal obligations, vital interests of the data subject, public interests, and legitimate interests as stated in Article 6(1) GDPR.
Based on the GDPR, the consent must be bound to one or several specified purposes which must then be sufficiently explained. Further, in accordance with the GDPR, consent must be unambiguous, which means that it requires either a statement or a clear affirmative act. Consent cannot be implied and must always be given through an opt-in, a declaration, or an active motion, so that there is no misunderstanding that the data subject has consented to the particular processing. However, there is no form requirement for consent, even if written consent is recommended due to the accountability of the controller. It can therefore also be given in electronic form.
The PDP Bill does not provide a definition of the term consent. However, the PDP Bill refers to consent as one of the requirements to be validly obtained from the personal data owner for processing their personal data after the purpose of processing is explained to them. Under the PDP Bill, the consent may be provided in the form of a written statement (electronically or manually) or recorded verbal consent.
The PDP Bill also provides that consent is not a sole requirement to carry out the processing of personal data. Consent is not required if the processing of personal data is necessary for the following matters:
Based on the above, it can be understood that the PDP Bill has a similar treatment of the consent requirement to the GDPR, whereby the consent is not a sole requirement for the processing of personal data.
The GDPR provides that the responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on the controller's behalf should be established. In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with the GDPR, including the effectiveness of the measures. These measures should take into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
On the other hand, with respect to a processor, the GDPR provides that the processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or of the processor, who has access to personal data, shall not process those data except on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law.
With respect to the personal data controller, the PDP Bill provides that the personal data controller must be responsible for the processing of personal data and demonstrate its responsibility in fulfilling the obligations of implementing the personal data protection principle.
Meanwhile, the personal data processor's responsibility is limited to conducting the processing of personal data based on instruction or order of the personal data controller, unless otherwise provided under the laws and regulations.
Based on the scope of responsibilities of the personal data controller and personal data processor under the GDPR and the PDP Bill above, it can be seen that the treatment of such responsibilities is similar.
The GDPR established the concept of a DPO in Europe. Contrary to popular belief, decisions on the legal obligation to appoint a DPO is not based on the size of the company but on the core processing activities, which are defined as those essential to achieving the company's goals. If these core activities consist of processing sensitive personal data on a large scale, or a form of data processing which is particularly far-reaching for the rights of the data subjects, the company has to appoint a DPO.
The duties of a DPO include: working towards compliance with all relevant data protection laws, monitoring specific processes, such as Data Protection Impact Assessments ('DPIAs') or the awareness-raising and training of employees for data protection, as well as collaborating with the supervisory authorities.
The PDP Bill introduces the role of DPO and the requirements for the appointment of one, whereas the pre-existing laws on the subject of data protection do not deal with this role and these requirements.
Under the PDP Bill, the DPO must be appointed if: (i) the processing of the personal data is in the public interest; (ii) the main activities of the personal data controller have a nature, scope, and/or purpose which require regular and systematic monitoring; and (iii) the main activities of the personal data controller consist of the large-scale processing of personal data that has a specific nature and/or personal data in relation to a criminal action.
The duties of the DPO under the PDP Bill are mainly to ensure that the personal data controller or processor complies with the personal data protection provisions under the PDP Bill, to monitor and ensure compliance with the PDP Bill and the policy of the personal data controller and personal data processor, to advise on DPIAs based on the performance of the personal data controller and personal data processor, and to coordinate and act as a contact person for issues related to the processing of personal data.
Based on the above, it can be seen that the role and duties of the DPO under the GDPR and the PDP Bill are similar.
Based on the above comparison, it can be understood that the changes and new concept and requirements introduced in the PDP Bill that have been specifically discussed above generally adopt the provisions of the GDPR, although there may be certain aspects where the GDPR provides much more comprehensive requirements compared to the PDP Bill, such as the strict requirements for cross-border transfers of personal data from EU countries to other countries or third country or international organisation.
However, the enactment of the PDP Bill is expected to bring improvement to the implementation of protection of personal data in Indonesia in all sectors, specifically in the areas of telecommunication services and technology, which now play an important role in the development of the Indonesian economy. Clearer provisions and requirements for personal data protection compliance could bring convenience and trust to consumers who use the services of business in the fields of telecommunications and technology, which in turn could develop and strengthen these sectors, as well as other sectors, such as the e-commerce sector, which relies on the effectiveness and development of telecommunications and technology.

In particular, the ICCL noted the Belgian DPA's conclusion that the IAB TCF allows companies to swap sensitive information about people even when this has not been authorised, and provides inadequate controls for the processing of intimate personal data that occurs in the real time bidding ('RTB') system, which is used by Google and other companies. In addition, the ICCL highlighted findings which may affect organisations outside of Europe, including the fact that the IAB began to market a system in the US that is based on the IAB TCF, and presented it as a compliance system for theÂ California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (last amended in 2019) ('CCPA'), and the recent launch of the IAB Privacy Lab together with the IAB TechLab, aiming to produce variants of the IAB TCF for regional laws.

'''Companies and organisations that collect or use data from US citizens and residents need to be aware of the ADPPA and the impact this new legislation may have on their business.Â 
Businesses that have already taken steps to comply with the GDPR will not be able to rely on their current practices to ensure they also comply with the ADPPA. We have outlined below the similarities and differences and a few of the areas that business should consider more closely.
Most businesses operate globally and, depending on how they collect and handle data, may be governed by several different privacy laws that apply in different jurisdictions, so it is important to understand the impact of both the ADPPA and the GDPR.
After on-going negotiations and compromises, the ADPPA received almost unanimous support in the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce. This means that the ADPPA will continue to be negotiated on the House Floor, and if it passes, it will go to the Senate for review.Â

This will be a critical transition in how data and privacy is protected and governed in the US by creating a national minimum standard of protection. The existing privacy regime in the US is predominately regulated by a patchwork of state regulations, for instance, California has passed the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ('CPRA') and California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ('CCPA') to provide protection to its state's residents.
The ADPPA imposes requirements on any entity that collects, processes, or transfers personal information, referred to as 'covered data' in the ADPPA, and is subject to the Federal Trade Commission's ('FTC') jurisdiction (covered entity). This includes corporations, non-profits, and telecommunications companies operating in the US.
We note that 'covered data' under ADPPA only protects the data of US residents. This means that the ADPPA has not addressed the privacy shield challenged in the

It will be important for all businesses and organisations to monitor the ADPPA to see if it passes and if any changes are made to it before it is passed.Â 
Businesses should also ensure that they understand their obligations under any US state legislation and how the ADPPA impacts US state laws.
If the ADPPA passes, businesses and organisations should seek legal advice to understand their legal obligations and it would be best to harmonise any compliance and data privacy policies to make it easy for consumers to understand what is happening with their personal information.

'''The European Court of Human Rights ('ECtHR') fined Turkey â‚¬13,500, on 3 December 2019, in its decision ('the Decision') in 
In particular, the Case centresÂ around a complaint by the applicants, a group of lawyers, regarding the seizure of their electronic data by the judicial authorities for the purposes of criminal proceedings against another lawyer who had shared their office. Moroever, the Case states that the applicants sought to rely on Article 8 and Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights ('the Convention'), stating that theÂ confidentiality of their exchanges with their clientsÂ had been infringed because the digital files on the latterâ€™s cases had been copied by the judicial authorities during a search and the copies had been seized, even though they were irrelevant to the investigation.
In addition, the ECtHR held in its Decision that the measures imposed on the applicants had not corresponded to a pressing social need, had not been proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued or necessary in a democratic society and therefore found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The ECtHR also held that, due to the absence of sufficient procedural guarantees on a national level in the Case,Â the complaints under Article 13 of the Convention covered the same ground as the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention.
Finally, the ECtHR held that Turkey was to pay each applicant â‚¬3,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and â‚¬3,000 jointly in respect of costs and expenses.

''''Data concerning health', as defined by the GDPR and 'protected health information', as defined by the HIPAA, and implementing regulations are similar subsets of personal data that can include some of the most intimate information about a person, and, for that reason, are generally regarded by lawmakers of countries around the world as requiring statutory protection. Framed by Article 5 of the GDPR and the principles relating to processing of personal data listed therein, described below, this article will explore at a high level the similarities and differences between the principles underlying processing and protection of health and medical data under the GDPR and HIPAA. Through this analysis, after certain matters of scope and applicability are addressed, the many similarities between the processing and data protection principles of HIPAA and the GDPR will become clear.
Under the GDPR, 'data concerning health' is a special category of personal data under Article 9, and is defined as 'personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status'
Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 'protected health information' is defined as 'individually identifiable health informationâ€¦ transmitted by electronic media, maintained by electronic media, or transmitted or maintained in any other form or medium'
As demonstrated from the definitions above, data concerning health and protected health information cover quite similar sets of data, but a critical element of the definition of protected health information distinguishes it from data concerning health â€“ namely, the scope of entities to which the term applies and the context of the processing of the information. Under the GDPR, data falling under the definition of 'data concerning health' is not delineated by controller, processor, or industry type. However, under HIPAA, protected health information only relates to information 'created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse; and (2) Relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual'
Another important fundamental distinction is the type of action regulated by the applicable entity. Under the GDPR, a controller or processor's 'processing' of personal data is regulated, while under HIPAA a covered entity or business associate is restricted in the 'use' and 'disclosure' of protected health information. 'Processing' under the GDPR is broadly defined as 'any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction'
With these fundamental distinctions in mind, when dealing with appropriately defined data concerning health and protected health information, the GDPR's Article 5 principles relating to processing of personal information are also reflected in similar requirements under HIPAA at 45 C.F.R. Subpart C and Subpart E, in terms of uses and disclosures and protection of protected health information.
Article 5 of the GDPR states:
'1. Personal data shall be:
(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject ('lawfulness, fairness and transparency');
(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes ('purpose limitation');
(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ('data minimisation');
(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay ('accuracy');
(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject ('storage limitation');
(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures ('integrity and confidentiality').;
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 ('accountability')'.
Regarding lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, under the GDPR these principles require compliance with Article 6(1), which enumerates the lawful bases for data processing in addition to the applicable exemption to the prohibition on the processing of special categories of data under Article 9(2) of the GDPR. Distinct from GDPR, under HIPAA, the focal point of the analysis is the purpose of the use or disclosure or to whom the protected health information is disclosed rather than the underlying reasoning for the processing. Under HIPAA, certain uses or disclosures by covered entities or business associates are required, permitted without authorisation from the patient, or permitted after authorisation or with no objection from the patient
The similarities continue between Article 5(1)(b) and (c) and HIPAA related to purpose limitation and data minimisation. Similar in the way that the processing of data concerning health must be 'collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposesâ€¦' and 'limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed'
Storage limitation is a concept shared by GDPR and HIPAA, though the concept under each has opposing goals. Under HIPAA, required documentation of HIPAA compliance must be retained for six years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was effected, whichever is later
Accuracy, integrity, and confidentiality are important principles under the GDPR (Article 5(d) and (f)) and HIPAA, as demonstrated by the data subject rights outlined in Chapter 3 of the GDPR and HIPAA's Privacy Rule,
Although the GDPR ultimately vests the responsibility for compliance with the requirements of Article 5 (1) in the controller, HIPAA's rules apply to covered entities and business associates. However, similar to a data processing agreement under Article 28 of the GDPR that holds a processor accountable to the controller, a HIPAA business associate agreement holds the business associate accountable to the covered entity.
The differences between the data processing and data protection frameworks of the GDPR and HIPAA are most notable in terms of the breadth of their applicability.Â Any processor or controller of data concerning health is subject to the GDPR, while only covered entities and business associates are subject to HIPAA. However, any entity that is considered a covered entity under HIPAA in the U.S. and that processes data concerning health in the European Economic Area will find this type of analysis beneficial to identify administrative and operational synergies, potential redundancies, and gaps in compliance that could lead to potential liability.

In particular, in its response to the Draft Guidelines, Insurance Europe argued that the Draft GuidelinesÂ go beyond the text of the GDPR,Â since they state that the approval of a code of conduct will depend on the appointment of a mandatory body that shall police compliance with the code, when in fact the GDPR states that this is optional. Insurance Europe also noted thatÂ the organisational and financial burdenÂ for developing a code of conduct, appointing a mandatory monitoring body and maintaining the required structure, for the sole purpose of obtaining approval of the code and monitoring complianceÂ would significantly outweigh the benefits of having an approved code.
In addition, in its response to the Commission's questionnaire, Insurance EuropeÂ outlined, among other things, concerns about the difficulty in updating IT systems to ensure compliance with the GDPR, for example in relation to Privacy by Design and by Default and automated deletion of data, and the difficulties in classifying suppliers as either controllers or processors, the difficultyÂ inÂ adapting processor agreements, and allocating liability between the controller and the processor.

In particular, the BEUC found the language used by Google as part of its registration process to be unclear, incomplete, and misleading, and additionally that important information concerning what data processing the three main account settings entail, or with regards to options that the user can choose from, is either not presented upfront, is vague, or is missing. In addition, the BEUC noted that it had launched, in November 2018, a series of coordinated complaints regarding the processing of consumer location data by Google, but that such complaints remain unresolved.
Accordingly, the Transfer Atlantic Consumer Dialogue ('TACD'), of which the BEUC is a member, released, on 30 June 2022, a statement on the same consumer action, clarifying that, in the US, ten consumers and digital groups from the TACD network wrote to the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') to urge it to take concerns regarding Google into consideration and open an investigation into Google's practices to ensure that US consumer privacy rights are protected. Furthermore, the TACD determined that the alleged practices may violate the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914.

'''The Data Protection Commission ('DPC') issued, on 20 August 2021, Decision No. IN-20-7-1, in which it imposed a fineÂ of â‚¬1,500 on, and issues a reprimand to, MOVE Ireland, for violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a personal data breach notified to the DPC.
Background to the case
In particular, the DPC highlighted that it had initiated its investigation into the personal data breach following a notification from MOVE on 3 February 2020, regarding the loss of 18 SD cards that contained recordings of group sessions of MOVE's programme, where participants discussed their behaviour and attitudes with regard to domestic violence with a facilitator. More specifically, the DPC outlined that the SD cards included participants' disclosure of behaviours, feelings, and attitudes towards current or ex-partners, other family members, and friends who may have been named by the participants.
Findings of the DPC
In its findings, the DPC noted that there were inadequate procedures to ensures that facilitators were adhering to security policies, in that there was no guarantee that recordings retained on the SDÂ cards were deleted in line with internal policies. Furthermore, the DPC detailed that there was inadequate measures to control the upload of personal data from the SD cards to theÂ personal equipment of facilitatorsÂ and to ensure its subsequent deletion, noting that there were noÂ methods in place forÂ monitoring each upload. Likewise, the DPC outlined that there was an overall failure on the part of MOVE to track and log the location of SD cards.
Accordingly, the DPC found that MOVE had violated Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the GDPR by failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented by the processing of recorded group sessions on SD cards containing participants' and facilitators' personal data.
Outcomes 
In conclusion, the DPC imposed a fine of â‚¬1,500 on MOVE for violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the GDPR. In addition, the DPC issued MOVE with a reprimand in respect of the infringements, and a corrective measure to bring the processing of recording sessions on SD cards into compliance with the applicable articles of the GDPR.

Background to the decision
In particular, the DPC noted that the inquiry commenced in respect of 22 personal data breach notifications that the Bank of Ireland made to the DPC between 9 November 2018 and 27 June 2019. Furthermore, the DPC highlighted that the breach notifications related to the corruption of information in the Bank of Ireland's feed to the Central Credit Register ('CCR'), a centralised system that collects and securely stores information about loans.
Moreover, the DPC emphasised that the incidents included unauthorised disclosures of customer personal data to the CCR and accidental alterations of customer personal data on the CCR.
Findings of the DPC
In the circumstances, the DPC found that 19 of the incidents reported met the definition of a personal data breach under the GDPR.
In its findings, the DPC found that the Bank of Ireland infringed Article 33 of the GDPR in respect of 17 of the incidents reported. Particularly, the DPC issued that Article 33(1) of the GDPR was infringed by the Bank of Ireland's failure to report the personal data breach without undue delay. In addition, the DPC found that the Bank of Ireland infringed Article 33(3) of the GDPR for failure to provide sufficient detail to the DPC in respect of some personal data breaches.
Moreover, the DPC noted that the Bank of Ireland infringed Article 34 of the GDPR in respect of 14 of the incidents reported, where the infringements concerned a failure by the Bank of Ireland to issue communications to data subjects without undue delay in circumstances where the personal data breaches were likely to result in a high risk to the data subjects'Â rights and freedoms.
Lastly, the DPC stated that Article 32(1) of the GDPR was infringed by the Bank of Ireland by failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented by its processing of customer data in transferring information to the CCR.
Outcomes

'''The Data Protection Commission ('DPC') issued, on 23 March 2021, a decision in proceedings IN-19-7-2, fining the Irish Credit Bureau ('ICB')Â â‚¬90,000 for failing to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a data breach which occurred when the ICB implemented a code change that contained a technical error. In particular, the DPC found that the ICB database had inaccurately updated the records of 15,120 closed accounts and provided 1,062 inaccurate account records to financial institutions or data subjects before fixing the issue. Furthermore, the DPC outlined that, although the inaccurate records did not misstate that a balance was outstanding on the accounts, they did state that the accounts had been closed more recently than they actually had been.
As a result, the DPC held that the ICB had infringed Article 25(1) of the GDPR by failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to implement the principle of accuracy in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of the GDPR and protect the rights of data subjects. Moreover, the DPC found that the ICB had infringed Article 5(2) and 24(1) of the GDPR by failing to demonstrate compliance with its obligation, pursuant to Article 25(1) of the GDPR, to undertake appropriate testing of proposed changes to its database.
However, the DPC outlined that the ICB had not infringed Article 26(1) of the GDPR in circumstances where the ICB members were not joint controllers in respect of the ICB's database.

Moreover, the DPC decided to impose the following corrective measures in accordance with Sections 111(3) and 124(3) of the 2018 Act:
In addition, the DPC issued a reprimand to the Council for failing to ensure that the DPO was involved in a timely manner in installing the CCTV system, for failing to carry out a DPIA in advance of installing a new CCTV system, and for failing to publish a data protection policy on drones prior to conducting surveillance with drones for law enforcement purposes.
Outcomes
In its outcomes, the DPC imposed a fine of â‚¬50,000 for the lack of signage and general transparency in relation to the Council's use of CCTV cameras for traffic management purposes pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR, weighing the Council's CCTV policy being public as a mitigating factor. Furthermore, the DPC fined the Council â‚¬25,000 for failing to take appropriate measures to make the information in the draft CCTV policy transparent and easily accessible pursuant to Article 12 of the GDPR. Moreover, the DPC fined the Council â‚¬35,000 for the rejection of subject access requests at traffic management centre pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR.

In particular, the DPC highlighted thatÂ its inquiry examined the extent to which Meta complied with the requirements of Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 24(1) and 32(1) of the GDPRÂ in relation to the processing of personal data relevant to the 12 breach notifications. Further, the DPC outlined that, given that the processing under examination constituted cross-borderÂ processing, the DPC's decision was subject to the co-decision-making process outlined in Article 60 of the GDPR and all of the other European supervisory authorities were engaged as co-decision-makers.

Background to the case
In particular, the DPC noted that the inquiry had commenced on 9 March 2020, when the Council notified the DPC of a personal data breach. Moreover, the DPC highlighted that the personal data breach occurred when a phishing email was accessed by two staff members of the Council, allowing for the creation of an auto-forward rule from their email accounts to a malicious email account. As a result, the DPC confirmed that, between 17 February 2020 and 6 March 2020 when the auto-forward rule was discovered, 323 emails were forwarded to the unauthorised external email address. In addition, the DPC detailed that the emails contained the personal data of 9,735 data subjects and the sensitive personal data (i.e. details of the criminal conviction) of one data subject.
Findings of the DPC
In addition, the DPC noted that the scope of the inquiry was to examine whether or not the Council had discharged its obligations in connection with the subject matter of the personal data breach, and dto etermine whether or not any provisions of the Data Protection Act 2018 and/or the GDPR had been contravened by the Council in that context.
Furthermore, the DPC found that the Council infringed Articles 5(1) and 32(1) of the GDPR for failing to process personal data held in manual or electronic form in a manner that ensured the appropriate security of the personal data using adequateÂ technical and organisational measures. Moreover, the DPC also confirmed that the Council was in violation of Article 33 of the GDPR by failing to notify the DPC of the personal data breaches when it ought to have been aware of them.
In addition, the DPC imposedÂ corrective measures on the Council to bring its processing operations into compliance with Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the GDPR, requiring the Council to implement adequateÂ technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. In coming to this decision, the DPC noted that a significant number of data subjects was affected by the aforementioned personal data breach, and that unauthorised access was achieved by way of two successful phishing attempts. Further to this, the DPC issued a reprimand toÂ the CouncilÂ in respect of its infringements of Articled 5(1), 32(1), and 33(1) of the GDPR, and noted that this is appropriate, necessary, and proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with the infringements, as the reprimand will act to formally recognise the serious nature of all of the infringements.
Further to its finding, the DPC found that an administrative fine is necessary to provide an effective, proportionate, and dissuasive response to the serious nature and gravity of the infringement, its negligent character, the sensitivity of the personal data, and the subject of the personal data breach. More specifically, the DPC confirmed that the Council's infringement of Articles 5(1), 32(1), and 33(1) of the GDPR posed a significant threat to the rights and freedoms of data subjects affected.
Outcomes
Finally, the DPC imposed a fine of â‚¬40,000 for the infringements of Articles 5(1) and 32(1) of the GDPR, as well as a fine ofÂ â‚¬20,000 for the infringement of Article 33(1) of the GDPR.

In particular, the EDPB highlighted that it had requested that the DPCÂ amend itsÂ draft decision regarding infringements of transparency, the calculation of the fine, and the period for the order to comply. More specifically, the EDPB outlined that in addition to theÂ DPC's findings, that WhatApp had committedÂ a severe breach of Articles 12, 13, and 14 of the GDPR in relation to theÂ information provided to users, as well as that it had further identifiedÂ additional shortcomings with the information provided, impacting users'Â ability to understand the legitimate interests being pursued, and therefore requested that the DPC's decision include a finding of aÂ violation ofÂ ArticleÂ 13(1)(d) of GDPR. Moreover, the EDPB outlined that there had also been a violation ofÂ the principle of transparency as enshrined under Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR, and requested that this be reflected in the final fine amount.Â 
In addition, the EDPB made a number of requests and provided clarifications in terms of the calculation of the fine itself. Specifically, the EDPB decided that the turnover of an undertaking is not exclusively relevant for the determination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with ArticleÂ 83(4)-(6) of the GDPR, but it may also be considered for the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in accordance with ArticleÂ 83(1) of the GDPR. Therefore, the EDPB found that the consolidated turnover of the WhatsApp's parent company, Facebook Inc., shouldÂ be included in the turnover calculation. Furthermore, the EDPB provided, for the first time, clarification on the interpretation of ArticleÂ 83(3) of the GDPR, highlighting that when faced withÂ multiple infringementsÂ for the same or linked processing operations,Â all the infringements should be taken into consideration when calculating the amount of the fine.
Lastly, the DPC's final decision includesÂ an order to bring processing operations into compliance within a period of three months, having been reduced from the six-month timeframe initially provided by the DPC's draft decision,Â as requested by the EDPB, which had highlighted the vital importance of ensuringÂ compliance with transparency obligationsÂ in the shortest timeframe possible.

Background to the decision
In particular, the DPC stated that it had received,Â on 10 December 2019, a personal data breach notification from the PIAB. More specifically, the DPC outlined that the personal data breach occurred when an unnamed consultancy provider, contracted by the PIAB, had returned materials containing personal data to the PIAB on an unencrypted USB storage device in a paper envelope. Subsequently, the DPC reported, theÂ USB storage device was misplaced in transitÂ with only a ripped envelope delivered to the PIAB. As such, the DPC commenced inquiries into the conduct of the PIAB with respect to the breach pursuant to Section 110(1) of the Data Protection Act 2018 ('the Act').
Findings of the DPC
In light of the above, the DPC found that the PIAB had not violated Article 32(1) of the GDPRÂ since the PIABÂ had expressly requested in advance that further personal data not be transmittedÂ as the PIAB was already in receipt of hard copies of the main relevant reports. In this regard, the DPC determined that the PIAB could not have foreseen that the materials in question containing personal data would have been transmitted in that manner.
Outcomes
As a result, the DPC held that the PIAB had not violated Article 32(1) of the GDPR and, therefore,Â it did not issue any corrective measures. Additionally, the DPC stated that the PIAB had a right to appeal the decision within 28 days after receipt of the decision. Simultaneously, the DPC issued a reprimand to the unnamed consultancy provider.

Background to the notice
In particular, the Information Commissioner outlined that the data subject submitted a right of access request on 11 May 2021, which was not fulfilled at the date of the enforcement notice.
Findings of the Information Commissioner
Notably, the Information Commissioner concluded that it was not satisfied that Port St Mary could maintain its assertion of legal privilege in respect of the documents requested by the data subject provided in the legal privilege and, therefore, is not justified in continuing to refuse to provide a copy of its personal data to the data subject. Specifically, the Information Commissioner outlined that, in order to, engage its legal privilege, litigation has to be actual or reasonably in prospect, not a mere possibility and it is not sufficient that there is a distinct possibility that sooner or later someone might make a claim, nor is a general apprehension of future litigation enough.
Therefore, the Information Commissioner determined that although some personal data has been provided to the data subject, Port St MaryÂ infringed, and continues to infringe, Articles 12 and 15 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Consequently, the Information Commissioner was satisfied that Port St Mary violated its responsibilities to fulfil a data subject access request and thus ordered Port St Mary to comply with the request by providing the data subject with a copy of their personal data and a copy of the same to the Information Commissioner within 30 days of the aforementioned issue date.

'''The Italian Competition Authority ('AGCM') published, on 26 November 2021, its resolutionÂ in proceeding PS11150, as issued on 9 November 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10 millionÂ to Apple Distribution International Limited, for violations of Articles 21, 22, 24, and 25 of the Legislative Decree No. 206/2005, Consumer Code, following an investigation regarding some commercial practices of the company.Â 
Background to the case
In particular, the AGCM explainedÂ that Apple collects, profiles, and commercially uses consumer data through the use of their devices and services. Moreover, the AGCM statedÂ that while Apple does not disclose any data to third parties, it does directly exploit the economic value of that data through promotional activity to increase sales of their own and/or third-party products through theirÂ App Store, iTunes Store, and Apple Books online retail platforms. In this context, the AGCM found that there is a consumer relationship between users and Apple, even in the absence of any monetary obligation, which is substituted by the data consumers, given up by using Apple's services.
Findings of the AGCM
The AGCM stated that Apple failed to provide clear and immediate information on the acquisition and use of user data for commercial purposes. In particular, the AGCM found that Apple does not immediately and explicitly tell consumers when creating an Apple ID or when accessing the Apple's online retail platformsÂ that their information will be collected and used for commercial purposes, only emphasising that the collection of their information is necessary to improve consumer experience and enjoyment of Apple's services. The AGCM found the deceptiveness, that characterised Apple's promotional activity, in violation ofÂ Articles 21 and 22 of the Consumer Code, based on the omission and failure to highlight the collection and use of the user's personal data for commercial purposes on the company's website.
Furthermore, the AGCM highlighted that Apple's promotional activity is based on a method of acquiring consent to the use of the users' data for commercial purposes without providing them with the possibility of prior and express choice on the sharing of their data. More specifically, the AGCM found that the acquisition architecture set up by Apple does not make it possible for consumers to exercise their will on the use of their data for commercial purposes, thus violating Articles 24 and 25 of the Consumer Code.

The AGCM also held that Facebook breached Articles 24 and 25 of the Consumer Code on aggressive practices, for undue influence on registered consumers.

Background to the case
In particular, the AGCM explained that Google bases its economic activity on offering a wide range of internet-related products and services,Â including online advertising technologies, search tools, cloud computing, software, and hardware, which are also based on the profiling of users and carried out using their data. In this context, the AGCM found that there is a consumer relationship between users and Google, even in the absence of any monetary obligation, which is substituted by the data consumers, given up by using Google's services.
Findings of the AGCMÂ 
The AGCM stated that Google had failed to provide clear and immediate information on the acquisition and use of user data for commercial purposes. In particular, the AGCM established thatÂ Google, both in the phase of creating an account, which is indispensable for the use of all the services offered, and during the use of the services themselves, omitted relevant information that consumers needÂ in order to make an informed decision when accepting that the company collects and uses their personal information for commercial purposes. Thus, the AGCM found that Google had not providedÂ consumers with information in a timely and adequate manner and therebyÂ violatedÂ Articles 21 and 22 of the Consumer Code.
Furthermore, the AGCM highlighted that, during the account creation phase, Google pre-sets the user's acceptance of the transfer and/or use of theirÂ data for commercial purposes. The AGCM explained that this pre-activation allows the transfer and use of the data by Google, once they are generated, without the need for further steps, in which the users can confirm or modify the choice pre-set by the company from time to time. Therefore,Â the AGCM fined GoogleÂ for considerably restricting the consumers' freedom of choice because of the automaticÂ transfer of their data to Google, thus violating ArticlesÂ 24 and 25 of the Consumer Code.

'''The First Section of the Civil Court of Cassation issued, on 19 December 2019, Ordinance No. 34113/2019 ('the Ordinance') on the principle of data minimisation under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular,Â the Ordinance addresses a case in which an individual complainant argued thatÂ Banco di Napoli S.p.A., creditor of the individual in relation to a mortgage, disclosed the individual's sensitive data to a third party, such as the debtor's situation and home address, resultingÂ in a violation of the Personal Data Protection Code, Legislative Decree No. 196/2003 ('the Privacy Code'). Furthermore, the Ordinance finds that the complainant did not provide any evidence provingÂ that the disclosureÂ to the third party has been made in breach of the data minimisation principle outlined inÂ from Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR. Lastly, the Ordinance states that Banco di Napoli cannot be considered as havingÂ committed a breach of the Privacy Code.

Furthermore, the Ordinance outlines that Deutsche Bank had blocked the consumer's bank account since the consumerÂ hadÂ not consented to the processing of their sensitive data. Moreover, the Ordinance highlights that the contractual clause is in violation of the principle of data minimisation, provided by Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, as the requested sensitive data were not necessary in relation to the purposes of the processing activity, and that the same clause cannot be considered a lawful expression of the principle of contractual freedom under Article 1322 of the Civil Code.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 25 February 2021, its decision in whichÂ it issued a â‚¬4,000 fine against the Ministry of Education's regional office for Lazio. In particular, the decision outlines a complaint received that documentation containing personal data concerning a minor, including information relating to the state of health of the minor, had allegedly been sent to the Department of Public Administration. In its defence, the office maintained that it had fulfilled a specific regulatory obligation in sending documentation accompanying a detailed report issued following a specific request from an inspection body.
However, the decision found that the communication of personal data and health data relating to the complainant's child, including the diagnosis indicating the minor's disability, was not necessary in order to provide feedback regarding alleged irregularities in the allocation of support hours as requested by the Department of Public Administration. Consequently, Garante deemed it necessary to impose an administrative sanction of â‚¬4,000 for the violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 6 and 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') within 30 days of notification of the sanction.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 10 March 2022, its decision in Case No. 82, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬8,000 on the Abruzzo Regional Environmental Protection Agency ('the Agency'), for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 6, and 10 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and Articles 2-
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante noted that, according to the complaint, a resolution of the Director General of the Agency had been published on the Agency's institutional website in its entirety, without any prior anonymisation of the complainant's personal data, and, moreover, was indexed on search engines. More specifically, the Garante outlined that the resolution in question contained information relating to a legal matter concerning the employment relationship between the complainant and the Agency, with references to events related to criminal proceedings involving the complainant, for which the same had been acquitted.
Further to this, the Garante explained that it had notified the Agency of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative sanction, inviting the same to present its defence briefs and to ask to be heard.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, at the end of the investigation carried out and based on the defence briefs presented by the Agency, the Garante considered that, contrary to what the Agency had argued, the online disclosure of the complainant's personal data could not be justified by the circumstance that it was deemed necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, and thus lacked a legal basis. In fact, the Garante highlighted that public authorities may not rely on contractual or pre-contractual necessity as legal basis for the dissemination of personal data.
In addition, the Garante rejected the Agency's argument that the information contained in the resolution did not constitute personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses, in consideration of the fact that the criminal proceedings had ended with the acquittal of the complainant. In this regard, the Garante pointed out that, as stated by the Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU'), information relating to judicial proceedings against a natural person constitute data relating to offences and criminal convictions, irrespective of whether or not the proceedings end with a conviction.
Separately, with regard to the circumstance that the personal data of the complainant had already been made manifestly public by the same as a result of press articles prior to the resolution in question, the Garante reiterated that public authorities may disclose personal data only in cases provided for by of law or regulation, notwithstanding the fact that the same data has already been disclosed by the data subjects.
Therefore, the Garante held that the disseminated personal data of the complainant, also relating to criminal convictions and offences, by the Agency was in violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 6, and 10 of the GDPR and Articles 2-
In light of the violations occurred, the Garante imposed an administrative fine. In quantifying the same, the Garante took into accountÂ the fact that the violations took place despite the guidelines issued by the Garante to aid public authorities, the considerable period of time over which the complainant's personal data was disseminated, and the particular sensitivity of the personal data published. Conversely, the Garante considered favourably, among others, the fact that only one data subject was affected.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. In addition, the Garante highlighted that the Agency has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed and that, within the same timeframe, it may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant had received several unsolicited promotional SMS and that they had been unable to fully exercise their right of access and right to object. More specifically, the Garante outlined that the promotional SMS identified B&T as the relevant organisation, and that, in the course of various discussions between the same and the complainant, B&T had claimed that it was not involved in the material sending of the promotional SMS, which were instead provided on its behalf by a third party, inviting the complainant to submit their request to a different email address. Subsequently, the Garante highlighted that the complainant had received a communication from the responsible marketing company, Aimon, which had indicated to the complainant that in the sending of the promotional SMS, it had used the data provided by a database supplier, which, Aimon claimed, was the data controller. However, the Garante stated that Aimon did not provide the complainant with any details regarding the identity of the database supplier, and solely informed the complainant that their request would be forwarded to Runwhip's email address.
Further to this, the Garante noted that it had notified the complaint to all the entities involved, i.e. B&T, Aimon, and Runwhip, asking them to provide their comments on the case in question. While Runwhip did not provide any response, the Garante stated thatÂ B&T and Aimon had provided the Garante with their observations, following which the Garante notified B&T and Aimon of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative sanction.
Notably, the Garante highlighted that the complaint in question did not represent an isolated case, as during the investigation, it had received a similar complaint by a different data subject.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that B&T had instructed Aimon to send promotional SMS to potential customers, and that to this end, Aimon had made use of database suppliers (in the case in question, the database was provided by Runwhip), which, in turn, had acquired the databases from third parties. In addition, the Garante determined that the personal data contained in the databases came from unverified lists compiled by listÂ editors, without an establishment nor a representative in the EU, who had used information deriving from registrations on online portals or competitions. In light of the elements acquired, the Garante determined that B&T and Aimon were the data controller and data processor respectively, and that, accordingly, Aimon had an obligation to correctly execute the instructions received from B&T. Importantly, the Garante outlined that B&T had contracted with Aimon three promotional campaigns, requiring Aimon to carry out checks on the lawfulness of the lists used, which Aimon did not fulfil. As such, the Garante took the view that Aimon, by acting in violation of the instructions received, had contributed to deprive the processing of the requirements of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, in violation of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR.Â 
Moreover, the Garante considered that the instructions provided to Aimon by B&T included the task of acknowledging data subject requests to exercise their rights and of providing timely feedback. However, the Garante stated that Aimon's conduct had resulted in the impossibility for the data subjectÂ to obtain the requested information about the processing, in breach of Article 12 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the Garante noted that Aimon, despite having recorded the data subject's wish not to receive further promotional communications, had sent out an additional SMS, thus being in violation of Article 21 of the GDPR, and, given the absence of valid consent, in violation of Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR and Article 130 of the Code.
In light of the above violations, the Garante imposed an administrative fine, and, in determining the amount of the same, the Garante took into account, among other things, the severity and duration of the violation, since the processing continued from 2018 to 2020, with the sending of text messages to numerous mobile users, and the degree of responsibility of Aimon, which, on the basis of its professional expertise, should have been well aware of the rules to be followed when carrying out marketing activities. In addition to the administrative sanction, the Garante prohibited Aimon, in the performance of activities similar to those investigated, from using personal data without having verified the lawfulness of the original collection.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and prohibition, and noted that Aimon has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed, andÂ may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority, within the same timeframe.

Further to the above, the Garante explained that, since the abovementioned period had elapsed without any communications being received and considering that Alfa Shipyard had repeatedly failed to respond to subsequent requests from the Garante regarding the delay, it had initiated the procedure for the adoption of an enforcement action.
Findings of the Garante
Based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that Alfa Shipyard had failed to comply with the orders issued by the Garante in April 2021, as well asÂ with the general duty to cooperate with the Garante in the performance of its duties. As such, the Garante held that Alfa Shipyard had breached Article 83(6) of the GDPR and Article 157 of the Code.
In light of the above, the Garante imposed an administrative fine, and in quantifying the same, it took into account, among others, the fact that the nature of the violation was of significant nature, as it had ultimately lengthened the proceeding before the Garante.

Following itsÂ investigation, the Garante found that Alfa Shipysard had not provided any response to the request submitted by the complainant, in relation to the exercise of their rights pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR, which included their request for the deletion of their personal data. Moreover, following multiple requests from the Garante, the same stated that Alfa Shipysard had provided a response to the complainant;Â however, theÂ response was incomplete.
Therefore, the Garante found that Alfa Shipysard had not complied with the obligation to provide feedback to theÂ data subject's request, as required by Article 12 of the GDPR. As such, the Garante concluded thatÂ Alfa Shipysard had breachedÂ Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), and 5(1)(f) of the GDPR and Article 157 of the Code.
In light of the above, the Garante imposed an administrative fine, and in quantifying the same, it took into account, among others, the fact that the violation lasted for a significant period of time, and ceased solely after intervention of a law enforcement agency.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine on Alfa Shipysard, and highlighted that the same has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed.

Subsequently, the Garante noted thatÂ Amiu had published on its Facebook profile some videos and images captured through the use of the CCTVÂ cameras, from which the persons concerned could be identified orÂ identifiable.
Further to this, the Garante noted that it had requested Amiu to provide its observations on the facts at hand, and that the same had confirmed that the publication of the relevant images and videos, without concealing the identity of the persons concerned, had been caused by human error.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the Police had carried out an administrative check at Hotel Clarin and Morpheus Room, two accommodations located in Rome and managed by Anfiteatro Flavio, where it discovered the presence of a CCTV surveillance system. Having received a copy of the Police report, the Garante invited the Police to carry out further investigations, which led to ascertaining the absence, at Hotel Clarin, of any sign informing data subjects of the presence of CCTV surveillance. Further to this, the Garante outlined that it had notified Anfiteatro Flavio, as the data controller, of the initiation of the procedure of the adoption of the measures pursuant to Articles 58(2) and 83 of the GDPR, and that Anfiteatro Flavio did not submit any defence briefs.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, the Garante found that Anfiteatro Flavio had not provided data subjects with the required information on the presence of CCTV surveillance at Hotel Clarin, therefore, being in breach of Article 13 of the GDPR.
As such, the Garante outlined that, in determining the amount of the fine, it took into consideration, among other things, that Anfiteatro Flavio had not cooperated with the Garante in the course of the procedure, nor had it demonstrated that it had fulfilled its obligation. However, the absence of specific precedents against Anfiteatro FlavioÂ relating to violations of the GDPR was considered favourably.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 10 February 2022, its decision in Case No. 48, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬5,000 to Arte Del Vivere S.r.l., for violations of Articles 12 and 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complaint, the personal data of the complainant had been included in a website, managed by Arte Del Vivere, following a training the complainant had attended years before, and that the complainant had been unable to obtain the deletion of their personal data from the same, despite multiple requests submitted by phone and via email.
Following the receipt of the complaint, the Garante had ascertained that the website in question did not contain any information on the protection of personal data and that the complainant's personal data was in fact still available. Subsequently, the Garante stated that it had made several attempts to contact Arte Del Vivere, with no success, and that it had eventually notified the same of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an enforcement action. Consequently, the Garante noted that the alleged chairman of the board of directors of Arte Del Vivere had confirmed that they were unable to make any changes to the website.
Findings of the Garante
Further, at the end of the investigation carried out and based on the elements acquired, the Garante considered that Arte Del Vivere, as the data controller, had completely ignored its obligations under data protection law until the notification of the Garante, and noted that it had been unable to obtain any documentation, and thus to understandÂ in which capacity the alleged chairman operated on account of Arte Del Vivere. Nevertheless, the Garante considered that Arte Del Vivere, as the data controller, was to be held directly accountable for the failure to delete the complainant's personal data, regardless of the individual responsibilities of the individuals who acted on its account. Specifically, the Garante held that the failure to update the data on the website and to respond to the complainant's requests for deletion constituted a breach of Articles 12 and 17 of the GDPR.
In addition, the Garante determined that Arte Del Vivere, by failing to respond to the Garante during the investigation phase, had also infringed Article 157 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to the GDPR ('the Code'). However, the Garante considered that the investigationÂ had taken place amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and acknowledged the difficulties encountered. For these reasons, the Garante dispensed with the imposition of an administrative sanction in relation to such violation, considering the same solely within the more general negligence of Arte Del Vivere, to be assessed in relation to the aforementioned infringements of Articles 12 and 17 of the GDPR.
In light of the violations occurred, the Garante imposed an administrative sanction and, in quantifying the same, took into account, among others, the following aggravating and mitigating circumstances:

In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that Arte Del Vivere has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed and that, within the same timeframe, it may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

Based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante outlined that ASST Nord Milano had notified the data breach to the Garante only in June 2021, without providing the reasons for the delay. In addition, the Garante found that the personal data of the patients who had registered for the flu vaccine were indexed and freely traceable using a search engine, so that anyone could have been able to access the relevant files. Importantly, the Garante determined that this was due to the absence of a computer authentication system that should have restricted access to the files to authorised persons with appropriate authentication credentials only. Moreover, the Garante outlined that during the investigation, it had emerged that ASST Nord Milano's website used,Â for the booking of COVID-19 tests, the insecure network protocol 'http', which did not guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged between the user's browser and the server hosting ASST Nord Milano's website, nor did itÂ allow users to verify the authenticity of the website displayed.
In light of the above, the Garante held that ASST Nord Milano had violated Articles 5(1)(f), 25, and 32 of the GDPR, by failing to implement, since the initial phase of design of its website, technical and organisational measures suitable to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. In addition, the Garante determined that the aforementioned delay in notifying the data breach to the Garante infringed Article 33 of the GDPR.
Further, the Garante imposed a fine and, in quantifying the same, the Garante considered, on one hand, the fact that ASST Nord Milano had notified the data breach only following the request for comments submitted by the Garante, as well as the sensitive nature of the personal data involved, and, on the other hand, the cooperation of ASST Nord Milano during the investigation, which had promptly remedied the violations, despite the situation of emergency due to COVID-19. In addition, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. Â 
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned sanction and order, and highlighted that ASST Nord Milano has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. Within the same timeframe, ASST Nord Milano may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

In particular, the Garante outlined that the Municipality of Rome had contracted ATACÂ to manage the parking lots and implement a technological update to parking metres to offer new services and introduce new payment methods, including paymentÂ through use of vehicle registration numbers. DuringÂ its investigation, the Garante found that ATACÂ collected data from the parking meters without its role as data processor being defined as required by Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and as such was unlawful in violation of Articles 5(1)(a) and 6 of the GDPR.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 31 January 2022, in its monthly newsletter, its decision in Case No. 413, as issued on 25 November 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬400,000 on B&T S.p.A., for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1)(a), 12, 13, 14, and 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and Article 130 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') ('the Code'), following a complaint submitted by an individual, and in conjunction with a 
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant had received several unsolicited promotional SMS messages and that they had been unable to fully exercise their right of access and right to object. More specifically, the Garante outlined that the promotional SMS messagesÂ identified B&T as the relevant organisation, and that, in the course of various discussions between the same and the complainant, B&T had claimed that it was not involved in the material sending of the promotional SMS messages, which were instead provided on its behalf by a third party, inviting the complainant to submit their request to a different email address. The Garante outlined that, subsequently, the complainant had received a communication from the responsible marketing company, Aimon, which had indicated to the complainant that in the sending of the promotional SMS messages, it had used the data provided by a database supplier, which, Aimon claimed, was the data controller. However, the Garante detailed thatÂ Aimon did not provide the complainant with any details regarding the identity of the database supplier, and informed the complainant that their request would be forwarded to Runwhip's email address.
Further to this, the Garante noted that it had notified the complaint to all the entities involved, i.e. B&T, Aimon, and Runwhip, asking them to provide their comments on the case in question and that, while Runwhip did not provide any response, B&T and Aimon had provided the Garante with their observations, following which the Garante notified B&T and Aimon of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative sanction.
Notably, the Garante highlighted that the complaint in question did not represent an isolated case, as during the investigation, it had received a similar complaint by a different data subject.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that B&T had instructed Aimon to send promotional SMS messages to potential customers, and that to this end, Aimon had made use of database suppliers (in the case in question, the database was provided by Runwhip), which, in turn, had acquired the databases from third parties. In addition, the Garante determined that the personal data contained in the databases came from unverified lists compiled by listÂ editors, without an establishment nor a representative in the EU, who had used information deriving from registrations on online portals or competitions.
In light of the elements acquired, the Garante determined that B&T and Aimon were the data controller and data processor respectively, thereby rejecting the parties' claim that, with regard to the processing in question, the database suppliers were in fact the data controllers, while Aimon was the data processor and B&T had no responsibility at all. Further to this, the Garante took the view that B&T's failure to define the roles of the entities involved in the data processing in question had resulted in a breach of the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and of the obligations to provide data subjects with suitable information. In addition, the Garante held that B&T had failed to facilitate the exercise of the data subjects' rights, given the impossibility for them to easily trace the long chain of entities involved in the processing. In addition, the Garante considered that the level of control exercised by B&T on Aimon's operations was not adequate; for instance, B&T had never requested Aimon to provide any documentation proving the lawfulness of the lists used. Â 
Furthermore, the Garante held that the sending of a promotional SMS messages to the complainant, after the same had expressed their opposition to both Aimon and B&T, evidenced B&T's lack of appropriate procedures to take into account the choice of the complainant. Thus, the Garante held that B&T had failed to guarantee the exercise of the right to object, resulting, consequently, in the sending of a second SMS messages in the absence of valid consent.
In consideration of the violations occurred, the Garante imposed a fine, and in determining the amount of the same, the GaranteÂ took into account, among other things, the severity and duration of the violation, since the processing continued from 2018 to 2020, with the sending of text messages to numerous mobile users, and the degree of responsibility of B&T, which did not put in place any type of control over the activity of the data processor. In addition to the monetary penalty, the Garante ordered B&T to adopt suitable measures and to communicate within 30 days which initiatives have been undertaken.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and orders, and noted that B&T has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. The Garante clarified that, within the same timeframe, B&T may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 16 September 2021, its decision in Case No. 9719768, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬75,000 to Barilla G. e R. Fratelli S.p.A for violations of Articles 5(1)(a) and 88 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and Article 114 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to GDPR ('the Code'), for unlawfully processing personal data by incorporating a video surveillance system covering employee areas.
Background of the case
In particular, the Garante stated that, on 8 January 2020, according to Article 166(5) of the Code, it had notified Barilla of the alleged violations of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR and Article 114 of the Code on the principle of lawful processing of personal data.
In addition, the Garante stated that Barilla responded stating that the video surveillance system installed was installed for the exclusive purpose of protecting the company's legitimate security interest, and not for the surveillance of the employees.
Findings of the Garante
The Garante stated that, based on the statements and documentation submitted to it by Barilla regarding the positioning of the video cameras, it appeared that the areas subject to video recording also included areas facing access to the entrances and other areas reserved for the activitiesÂ of the employees. In this regard, the Garante recalled thatÂ areas in which employees pass or stop,Â if subject to video surveillance, are subject to the full application of the rules on the protection of personal data.
Furthermore, the Garante stated that in this case, the video recording system was positioned in such a way as to film areas where employees necessarily pass through in order to carry out their work activities, such as entrances, courtyards facing the workshop, and parking lot, and to areas dedicated to them, such as changing rooms, refreshment, and smoking areas.
Outcome
Finally, the Garante held that the processing of the employees' personal dataÂ was unlawful, from the date of installation and activation of the system, at least from November 2016Â until 20 January 2020 and, as such, it imposed a fine of â‚¬75,000.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 15 September 2022, its Decision No. 305, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10,000 on BPER Banca S.p.A.,Â for violations of Articles 12 and 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the receipt of a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complaint, BPER Banca did not satisfy the data subject deletion request of the complainant. In fact, after the receipt of the request, the Garante noted thatÂ BPER Banca asked forÂ identity verification of the complainant, who sent their verification, but then never received an answerÂ to theÂ data deletion request. In this context, the Garante provided that the complainant then sent a warning letter toÂ BPER BancaÂ through their lawyer in order to obtain the deletion of their data. Moreover, the Garante detailed that BPER Banca stated that the complainant's situation constituted an isolated and unfortunate episode in a general context of operations characterised by systematic and timely responses to requests to exercise the rights of data subjects.Â 
Findings of the Garante
As a result of the investigation, the Garante found the justifications brought by BPER Banca to be insufficient, explaining that, pursuant to Article 12 of the GDPR, the data controller shall facilitate the exercise of the rights of the data subjectÂ and shall provide the data subject with information on the action taken in respect of a request, pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR, without undue delay, andÂ in any event, at the latest within one month of receipt of the request.
Therefore, the Garante highlighted that such conduct violatedÂ Article 12 of the GDPR with reference to Article 17 of the GDPR, given that, once the need of BPER BancaÂ to verify the identity of the interested party requesting the exercise of the right to deletion had been satisfied. Moreover, the Garante noted that BPER BancaÂ did not follow up on the request within the timeframe provided for by the GDPR due to an undefined technical hitch, forcing the complainant, through their lawyer, to request the exercise of the right to erasure with a new request.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 24 March 2022, its decision in Case No. 107, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10,000 to Brav S.r.l., for violations of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a personal data breach notified by the Municipality of Genoa to the Garante.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante observed that it had received reports that ScatWeb, the traffic violations management platform owned by Brav and licensed to the local police force of the Municipality of Genoa, had been subject to unauthorised access. The Garante explained that such platform processed personal data of citizens who are the recipients of fines, and that the Municipality of Genoa had sent a breach notification to the Garante, detailing that the abusive access was caused by several police officers, who had not changed the default password assigned to them for the first access to the platform, and had thereafter divulged the same access credential.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante noted that the processing of data through ScatWeb was carried out as data processor by Brav on behalf of the Municipality of Genoa, the latter being the data controller. Additionally, the Garante held that the data processor, based on its technical expertise, should have cooperated proactively in the adoption of appropriate measures and in the systematic verification of their effectiveness, especially because, in the case in question, it provided its services to a plurality of data controllers involving a large number of data subjects.
According to the Garante, Brav was required to constantly verify the effectiveness of the measures put in place to protect the platform provided to the local police force of the Municipality of Genoa. The Garante clarified that, although access by several unauthorised individuals to the platform occurred due to the divulgation of access credentials by the local police force's internal staff, Brav should have in any case implemented technical and organisational measures ensuring that the passwords of authorised persons complied with quality criteria and were compulsorily changed the first time they were used.
Subsequently, the Garante outlined that, owing to human error, Brav did not have the server logs containing the IP addresses of the accesses to ScatWeb, and of the times during which the personal data breach in question occurred. As a result, the Garante maintained that Brav failed to adopt technical and organisational measures that ensured a level of security appropriate to the risks posed by the data processing, in breach of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the GDPR.
As such, the Garante imposed an administrative fine of â‚¬10,000 on Brav, and applied the ancillary sanction of the publication of such fine on the website of the Garante.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine, and highlighted that Brav has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. Lastly, the Garante outlined that, within the same timeframe, Brav may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

Background to the case
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant had sent the Health Authority a formal notice to comply with a decision of the National Institute of Social SecurityÂ in relation to a procedure concerning their social security position, following which the Health Authority, contrary to what was expressly stated in the notice, had sent a communication to the email address of the department, within the Health Authority, where the complainant worked as a manager. Additionally, the Garate noted that, according to the complaint, the complainant had presented a personal data access request, without receiving an adequate reply from the Health Authority.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the aboveÂ and based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation carried out, the Garante found that the Health Authority had breached Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(f), and 6(1)(e) of the GDPR and Article 2-
Moreover, the Garante outlined that the Health Authority had not responded to some of the Garante's requests for information in the course of the investigation and noted that the lack of cooperation affected the completeness and speed of the preliminary investigation. In light of this, the Garante took the view that the Health Authority violated Article 157 of the Code. Lastly, the Garante outlined that, in the course of the investigation, it emerged that the Health Authority had not correctly communicated to the Garante the name and contact details of the new data protection officer ('DPO'), thus infringing Article 37 of the GDPR.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 16 December 2021, its decision in case No. 435, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10,000 to Centro Medicina Preventiva Srl, a private medical centre, for violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 25(2), 32, and 37 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a data breach notification submitted by the medical centre to the Garante.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante noted that the medical centre had notified the Garante a data breach in connection with a cyber attack issued by a hacker group, which resulted in the publication,Â on the hackers' Twitter profile, of an image, partially obscured, containing personal data, including sensitive data, of patients and radio-diagnostic tests carried out in the medical centre on a certain date. In addition, the Garante reported that it had requested the medical centre to provide its comments, and that subsequently, it had initiated the procedure for the adoption of the measure pursuant to Article 58(2) of the GDPR.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that at the time of the data breach, the medical centre's server, if interrogated, returned the requested metadata (including names and dates of birth of patients, and type of examination performed) without verifying the identity and the credentials of the subject making the request, allowing unauthenticated connections to be reachable from outside the health centre. Considering this, and also taking into account the nature of the data being accessed, the purpose of the processing, as well as the high risks deriving from the possible acquisition of the data involved by third parties, the Garante considered that the security measures adopted by the medical centre could not be considered adequate.
Furthermore, the Garante considered that the violations occurred are subject to the application of a monetary penalty. In determining the amount of the same, the Garante took into account, among other things, the fact that the incident appeared to have been isolated, and determined by the malicious behaviour of a third party, and that the breach did not concern the content of medical reports. In addition to the monetary penalty, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned sanctions, and highlighted that payment must be received within 30 days. Lastly, the Garante noted that the medical centre has the right to lodge an appeal before the judicial authority within the same timeframe.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante stated that the Police of Florence had verified the presence of a CCTV system at the cultural club, which did not appear to comply with data protection requirements. Specifically, the Garante noted that the Police of Florence had ascertained the presence ofÂ CCTV cameras (six inside the cultural club and three outside), which were in use and connected to a computer system located inside the club's building, in the absence of any notice. Moreover, the Garante outlined that, according to the report received, two of the external CCTV cameras covered a portion of the public road.
Further to this, the Garante highlighted that it had notified the cultural club of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative sanction, inviting the same to provide its defence briefs, which, however, the cultural club did not submit.
Findings of the Garante
Based on the further assessments carried out, the Garante ascertained that the cultural club had processed personal data by means of a CCTV system breaching the basic principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, as well as ofÂ data minimisation, and that it had failed to provide notice of the same, thus violating Article 13 of the GDPR.
Given the above, the Garante imposed the aforementionedÂ fine and, in quantifying the same, the Garante considered, on one hand, the negligent conduct of the cultural club, and the lack of cooperation during the investigation, and on the other hand the absence of previous violations.

Background to the case
In particular, the Garante noted that Clearview AI, a company headquartered in the US, reportedly owns a database including over 10 billion facial images from individuals all over the world, which are extracted from public web sources via web scraping. In addition, the Garante pointed out that Clearview AI offers a sophisticated search service which allows, through AI systems, the creation of profiles, on the basis of the biometric data extracted from the images and associated metadata.
Additionally, the Garante outlined that the complaints received concerned various profiles of unlawfulness of the data processing carried out by Clearview AI, including its failure to respond to requests of access to data pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR, and the lack of consent to the processing. Notably, the Garante reported that some of the complainants who had contacted Clearview AI had received in response a special report which confirmed that Clearview AI did include the complainants' pictures in its database.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante examined the applicability of the GDPR to the processing carried out by Clearview AI, in response to the reiterated statements of Clearview AI according to which the same was not subject to the GDPR. Specifically, the Garante concluded that, as Clerview AI had admitted, the same had indeed offered its services in the EU and that, in any case, contrary to what Clearview AI had alleged, the database created did not appear to be a mere classification of individuals on the basis of known characteristics, such as age, sex, and height, but instead a further activity was carried out, consisting in the extraction of biometric data from the images collected on the web and in using them for comparative purposes. In light of this, the Garante highlighted that such activities were comparable to the monitoring of the behaviours of data subjects carried out by means of internet tracing and subsequent profiling. Therefore, the Garante determined that the GDPR applied to the processing in question by virtue of Article 3(2) of the GDPR.
Consequently, based on the elements acquired in the courts of the investigation, the Garante determined that the personal data held by Clearview AI, including biometric and geolocation information, was processed in violation of:

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 5 August 2022, its decision in Case No. 285, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬20,000 on Cosmopol Security S.p.A., for violations of Articles 12(3), 14, and 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante outlined that theÂ complainant alleged that Cosmopol Security had sent them electronic payment invoices without having ever had any contractual relationship with them, and that, for that reason, the same complainant had submitted an access request in order to understand how the personal data about them had been collected. Additionally, the Garante added that the complainant alleged that they had received no reply from Cosmopol Security within the terms set out in Article 12(3) of the GDPR.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above and based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that Cosmopol Security had not responded to the request for access to personal data made by the complainant, nor had it informed the same complainant of the reasons for the non-compliance. Moreover, the Garante outlined that, having collected the personal data of the complainant from a third party, Cosmopol Security had not provided the same complainant with the information set out in Article 14 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Garante found that the processing in question had been unlawful, thus breaching Articles 12(3), 14, and 15 of the GDPR.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 10 February 2022, its decision in Case No. 42, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10,000 to Costampress S.p.A., for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 12, and 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complaint, Costampress had failed to delete the complainant's company email account following the termination of the employment relationship, and had refused to assign to the complainant the company telephone number,Â which had previously been used by the complainant as a private number. In addition, the Garante noted that subsequently, the complainant had supplemented the complaint byÂ reporting that they had not been able to use the personal laptop they had previously used in the course of the employment relationship, and that they had also received a copy of some court files, from which it had emerged that Costampress had allowed a third party to access some private WhatsApp conversations between the complainant and their wife.
Further to this, the Garante invited Costampress to provide its comments on the facts in question, following which the Garante notified the same of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of enforcement actions.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, at the end of the investigation carried out and based on the elements acquired, the Garante found that Costampress had appointed an expert to process the data contained in the personal laptop used by the complainant during the period in which they had worked for the same, in the absence of any company documents informing the complainantÂ that Costampress reserved the right to carry out on company computers or other tools provided to its workers as part of the employment relationship. In this regard, the Garante pointed out that, in accordance with the constant orientation of the European Court of Human Rights ('ECtHR'), the protection of private life also extends to the workplace. Therefore, the Garante found Costampress in breach of Articles 12 andÂ 13 of the GDPR. Moreover, the Garante held that, in the employment context, the obligation to inform the data subject is also an expression of the general principle of the fairness of processing, concluding that Costampress had also breached Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR.
Separately, the Garante dismissed the complaint in relation to the contested failure to deactive the complainant'sÂ company email account, following the termination of the employment relationship, taking into account the short period of time that had elapsed until its deactivation. Likewise, the Garante dismissed the part of the complaint in relation to the failure to access the phone number previously used, on account of the fact that, having examined the defence briefs submitted by Costampress, it had emerged that the complainant had signed a contract which stated that the material handed over should be returned at the end of the employment relationship with Costampress. In a similar vein, the Garante deemed that there were no grounds for adopting sanctioning measures in relation to the violation of Article 20 of the GDPR concerning the right to data portability, and dismissed the relevant part of the complaint. Lastly, the Garante explained that no evidence of a personal breach was found, concluding that there were no grounds to adopt sanctioning measures in this regard.
In light of the violations occurred, the Garante imposed on Costampress an administrative sanction, and, in quantifying the same, it took into account, among others:
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and highlighted that Costampress has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed and that, within the same timeframe, it may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 9 June 2022, its decision in Case No. 215, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10,000 onÂ Cribis Credit Management s.r.l., for violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), and 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant had lamented a breach of the GDPR by Cribis Credit Management, which, in the interest of Sky Italia S.r.l., had sent multiple emails, concerning the payment of an invoice relating to the termination for default of the complainant's Sky subscription, to the company email address of a third party, specifically an employee of the company for which the complainant acts as representative.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above and based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that Cribis Credit Management, given impossibility to contact the complainant by phone, had used an email address found online to contact the complainant, believing that the same belonged to the actual debtor, rather than to a third party. In light of the established facts, the Garante held that Cribis Credit Management had violatedÂ Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), and 6 of the GDPR.
Subsequently, the Garante, based on the nature of the violations occurred, imposed an administrative fine on Cribis Credit Management, and in quantifying the same, it took into account, among other factors, the degree of liability of Cribis Credit Management, for failing to comply with data protection rules, despite clear guidance to debt collection operators issued by the Garante since 2005.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that Cribis Credit Management may lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority within 30 days.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 9 July 2021, a decision, issued on 10 July, to fine a dentist â‚¬20,000 for unlawfully collecting data on prospective patients' HIV infection history and refusing treatment to patients based on such data, in violation ofÂ Article 5(1)(a)-(c) of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('GDPR'). In particular, the Garante outlined that the dentist required that patients fill out a medical history questionnaire before receiving dental services at his office, including information on previous, existing, or suspected infectious diseases suchÂ tuberculosis, hepatitis, and HIV, and that the dentist carried out a blanket policy, effected in the case of the individual complainant, to refused treatment of individuals infected by such diseases in order to avert possible infection of staff and other patients.Â 
Furthermore, taking into account Law of 5 June 1990, No.Â 135 on the Program of Urgent Interventions for the Prevention and Fight against AIDS), which provides that specific precautions must be adopted by dentistsÂ for each individual patientÂ the Garante outlined that the collection of information pertaining to an individual's infection history should be done with a view to identifying the best course of medical treatment, rather than as a basis for refusing treatment. Therefore, the Garante outlined that the dentist's processing activities were notÂ lawful, correct, and transparent, norÂ adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary with respect to the purposes for which they are processed.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 16 June 2022, its decision in Case No. 226, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬20,000 to Deutsche Bank S.p.A., for violation of Articles 12(3) and 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant, following Deutsche Bank's reporting of their name to CRIF SpA, a credit bureau, had submitted to Deutsche Bank a request to access their personal data and to receive the information referred to in Article 13 of GDPR. Thereafter, the Garante explained that, according to the complaint, Deutsche Bank had failed to respond to such requests.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above and based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that Deutsche Bank had not provided a response to the request for access to the personal data formulated by the complainant, within the time limit provided for in Article 12(3) of the GDPR, nor had it informed the complainant, within the same period, of the reasons for non-compliance and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with the Garante. Specifically, the Garante rejected Deutsche Bank's argument according to which the request to exercise their rights was submitted by the complainant in the context of a broader and more articulated request by the same, which would have prevented a timely response, and outlined that such defence could not be taken as a valid ground for the exclusion of liability. In light of the above, the Garante found that Deutsche Bank had violated Articles 12(3) and 15 of the GDPR.
Subsequently, the Garante, based on the nature of the violations, imposed an administrative fine on Deutsche Bank, and in quantifying the same, it took into account, among other factors, the lack of previous infringements by Deutsche Bank.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and highlighted that Deutsche Bank may lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority within 30 days.

In particular, further to its investigation, the Garante found that, in spite of an explicit request by a patient that no third party and family member acquire information about their health, hospital staff accidentally contacted a family member and made them aware of the patient's health data, which had constituted a data breach in respect of health data. Further to this, the Garante considered that the hospital had not implemented adequate measures for managing records and telephone numbers of patients and had therefore violated Articles 5(1)(a), (d), and (f), 9 and 32(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('GDPR').

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 19 January 2022, its decision in case No. 443, as issued on 16 December 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬26,513,977 to Enel Energia S.p.A, for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(d), 5(2), 6(1), 12, 13, 21, 24, 25(1), 30, and 31 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and Articles 130(1), 130(2), 130(4) of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') ('the Code'), following numerous complaints submitted by individuals.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that it had received numerous complaints concerning the receipt of unwanted promotional calls, including pre-recorded ones, also by users registered in the register of oppositions; the lack or inadequate facilitation of data subjects' rights; and, more generally, various problems deriving from the processing of personal data in the context of energy supply services, including the processing activities carried out through the dedicated area of Enel Energia's website and the relative app. Following this, the Garante highlighted that is had carried out a complex investigation, which also covered Enel Energia's business partners and which included the submission of four separate requests for cumulative information, from December 2018 to July 2020, concerning a total of 135 files.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante, based on the elements acquired, found multiple instances of unlawfulness. Specifically, the Garante outlined that Enel Energia had breached Article 30 and Article 31 of the GDPR for not having sufficiently cooperated with the Garante during the course of the investigation. For example, the Garante noted that Enel Energia had not provided any response to various requests submitted by the GaranteÂ and that in other occasions, it had solely responded with a series of standardised answers. In addition, the Garante took the view that Enel Energia's claims that the numbers used to make the promotional phone calls did not belong to it, nor to its business partners, rather than being defensive statements, were in fact critical elements to determine Enel Energia's lack of effective counteractions against the promotional calls carried out in its name, especially considering that Enel Energia had directly received complaints for aggressive telemarketing practices, thus resulting in a breach of the principles of accountability and Privacy by Design. Moreover,Â the Garante added that the principle of accountability was also violated by Enel Energia's inability to prove compliance with data protection laws in relation to unwanted promotional calls carried out by a business partner, and for its failure to carry out the required checks on the activities of its business partners in general, which also resulted in a breach of its responsibilities as data controller.
Furthermore, the Garante considered that Enel Energia had violated the principle of accuracy, having erroneously associated the personal data of different data subjects in its records, which led to undue communications of personal data, also in the absence of any legitimate basis for doing so. Notably, the Garante found that Enel Energia had not respected the requirements for transparency and had not facilitated the exercise of data subjects' rights, including by failing to provide the necessary and timely feedback to the data subjects following their requests to exercise the right of right of access and the right to object. In addition, the Garante deemed Enel Energia in breach of Articles 21 of the GDPR and 130(1) and 130(2) of the Code, considering the undue sending of promotional communications by email, despite the lack of the data subjects' consent to the processing of their personal data for marketing purposes and the subsequent opposition to the processing expressly addressed via a separate email communication. With regards to the data processing activities in the context of Enel Energia's website and app, the same was found by the Garante in breach of the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, as well as of its disclosure obligations, for having presented website users with two conflicting statements as to the identity of the data controller and for having failed to provide data subjects with information necessary for the identification of the recipients of their personal data. The Garante had also found that Enel Energia had violated Article 130(4) of the Code, since it had sent communications regarding the registration to its loyalty program that qualify as 'soft spam'. Furthermore, the Garante considered that Enel Energia had violated the provisions of the GDPR and the Code on the requirements for valid consent, as it had acquired single declarations of consent from data subjects that covered multiple and generic purposes.
In consideration of the above, the Garante imposed a fine of â‚¬26,513,977, and in determining said amount, it took into consideration several aggravating factors, such as the seriousness of the violations, their durations and repeated nature, the high number of data subjects involved, and the negligent nature of the conduct. In addition to the fine, the Garante issued warnings to Enel Energia regarding the promotional campaigns, which will have to comply with data protection laws going forward, and also regarding circumstances relating to Enel Energia's behaviour in the course of the investigation. Moreover, the Garante ordered Enel Energia to implement further technical and organisational measures to manage the requests for the exercise of data subjects' rights, and to communicate to the Garante the measures undertaken to comply with the orders contained in the decision. Lastly, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on the Garante website as an ancillary sanction.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante issued the fine of â‚¬26,513,977 and aforementionedÂ warningsÂ and orders, and noted that Enel Energia has 30 days to lodge an appeal with the judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 19 February 2021, its decision to fine Enna Provincial Health Authority â‚¬30,000 for the use of an attendance monitoring system based on the processing of employees' biometric data. In particular, following its investigation, the Garante found that, through its attendance monitoring system, Enna had collected data from fingerprints of over 2,000 employees, which was subsequently stored in an encrypted form in employees' badges, and that, through this system, by presenting the fingerprints, the employee's registration number, as well as the date and time of stamping, were transmitted to the employee attendance management system.
Further to this, the Garante found that there had not been adequate legal basis for processing employees' biometric data, that employees' consent could not be considered as valid consent due to the dynamics of the working relationships, and that Enna had not provided adequate information on the processing of employees' biometric data. Therefore, the Garante considered that Enna had violated Articles 5(1)(a), 6 and 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('GDPR').

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 30 June 2022, its decision in Case No. 239, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬5,000 on the Federazione Italiana Sommelier, Albergatori e Ristoratori ('F.I.S.A.R.'), for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(f), and 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant had lamented a breach of the GDPR by F.I.S.A.R., whichÂ had sent an emailÂ concerning the complainant's exclusion from F.I.S.A.R., to all the members of the same. In particular, the Garante outlined that the complainant had allegedÂ that the exclusion hadÂ also been published in the F.I.S.A.R. cloud which every member can access. Moreover, the Garante explained that, according toÂ the complainant, theyÂ had formally appealed in the manner provided for in F.I.S.A.R.'s regulations and that the internal body recognised the merits of their opposition. Nonetheless, the Garante stated that theÂ complainant highlighted that the overturning of the exclusion decision has never been communicated to the other members, and that the exclusion measure was still published and visible in the F.I.S.A.R. cloud.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above and based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante found thatÂ the publication in questionÂ concerned a measure adopted by F.I.S.A.R. which was not yet final and was subsequently annulled by the Board of Arbitrators, which considered the appeal brought by the complainant legitimate.
Therefore, the Garante detailed that, in the face of a specific internal regulation that regulates the methods and limits of the disclosure of disciplinary measures within the association structure,Â the measure concerning the complainant was instead communicated to all members without verifying that it adheres to certain characteristics. Â Moreover, the Garante specified that, even after the annulment of the measure by the Board of Arbitrators, the disciplinary measure continued to be published on the cloud platform accessed by F.I.S.A.R. members, thus contributing to giving an irrelevant representation of the person concerned.
In light of the above, the Garante found that the processing in question is unlawful, thus breaching Article 6(1) of the GDPR, since it was carried out without complying with the conditions of lawfulness required by the provision, as well asÂ the general principles of lawfulness and minimisation of data, in relation to the purposes pursued, as set out in Article 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(c) of the GDPR.
Outcome of the decision
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that F.I.S.A.R. may lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority within 30 days.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 16 December 2021, its decision No. 439, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬20,000 to FCA Italy S.p.A., for
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante stated that the complainant, an English citizen, had filed a complaint with the ICO claiming that their right of access has been breached, as the same had requested FCA Italy to provideÂ the transcript of telephone conversations between the customer service, managed by FCA Customer Services Centre s.r.l., and the complainant, and the relevant case notesÂ concerning a malfunction in their vehicle. Further to this, the Garante noted that FCA Italy would have declared, by telephone, that it could not follow up on the above-mentioned requests due to some unspecified Italian privacy laws.
Subsequently, the Garante outlined that the ICO had communicated the complaint to all other European data protection authorities ('DPAs') concerned, following which the Garante had declared its competence as Lead DPA due to FCA Italy having its main establishment in Italy. In addition, the Garante noted that FCA Italy had presented the requested information regarding the processing in question, and that the Garante had notified the same of the alleged violations and issued a draft decision, having heard FCA Italy and examined the defense briefs presented.
Furthermore, the Garante outlined that, pursuant to Article 60 of the GDPR, it had sent the draft decision to the other DPAs concerned, receiving relevant and reasoned objections from the Austrian data protection authority ('DSB'). Having taken said objections into consideration, the Garante reported that it had issued a revised draft decision, to which none of the DPAs concerned raised any further objections.

Notably, the Garante took the view that FCA Italy's conduct was in breach of Articles 12(3), 12(4), and 15 of the GDPR, as FCA Italy:
Furthermore, based on the violations occurred, the Garante imposed an administrative sanction, and in quantifying the same, the Garante took into account, among other things, on one hand, that the violations had been mainly caused by FCA Italy's failure to implements appropriate measures aimed at guaranteeing the data subject access to their personal data, and, on the other hand, that no previous violations had been committed by FCA Italy and its cooperation during the investigation. In addition, the Garante ordered FCA Italy to communicate to the complainant their personal data contained in the case notes within 30 days, and more in general to communicate the actions taken to comply with the decision, within 90 days. Lastly, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.
Outcomes

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') annoucned, on 19 May 2022, in its newsletter, that it had issued, on 7 April 2022, its Decision No. 122, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10,000 to Findomestic Banca S.p.A., for the violations of Articles 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complainant, Findomestic Banca had allegedly contacted several times the complainant's spouse, who was the guarantor of one of the three loans that the complainant had borrowed from the former. However, the Garante explained that the debt collectionÂ calls in question concerned a loan for which the complainant's spouse did not act as guarantor. Subsequently, the Garante outlined that Findomestic Banca had explained that the contested facts had been the result of an internal misunderstanding which had caused the inclusion in the system of the spouse's telephone number as the main contactÂ for debt collection.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, at the end of the investigations carried out, the Garante found that Findomestic Banca had violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and data minimisation. Notably, the Garante highlighted that it had clarified, with a general order dated 30 November 2005, that anyone processing personal data in the context of debt collection activities must comply with the principle of lawfulness of the processing, which is violated in case of unjustified communications to third parties (such asÂ family members and work colleagues) concerning a debtor's arrears.
Based on the established facts, the Garante imposed an administrative fine and in quantifying it,Â took into account, among other things, the absence of previous violations and the prompt deletion of the spouse's telephone number from the file relating to the complainant's loan.
Outcomes

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 5 July 2021, that it had issued a decision to fineÂ FoodinhoÂ s.r.l., a digital platform under the control of parent company GlovoApp 23,Â â‚¬2.6 million for numerous privacy violationsÂ regarding the algorithms used for management of its employees. In particular, the Garante outlined thatÂ FoodinhoÂ had not adequately informed the workers on the functioning of the system and did not guarantee the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithmic systems used for the evaluation of the riders. In addition, the Garante highlighted thatÂ Foodinho had failed toÂ guarantee procedures to protect the right to obtain human intervention, express one's opinion, and contest the decisions adopted through the use of the algorithms in question, including in relation to anÂ algorithm thatÂ excludes someÂ of its riders from job opportunities. Furthermore, the Garante identified a number of further data protection shortcomings byÂ Foodinho, including regarding Data Protection Impact Assessments, technical and organisational security measures, data protection officer appointment, record-keeping, and Data Protection by Design.
In view of the foregoing, among other findings, the Garante found thatÂ Foodinho had violated ArticlesÂ 5(1)(a), (c) and (e),13,Â 22,Â 25, 30,Â 32,Â 35 andÂ 37 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and, in addition to the financial penalty, imposed a number of corrective measures onÂ Foodinho.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 26 May 2022, its Decision No. 201, as issued on the same date, in which it imposed fines for a total of â‚¬70,000 on Friuli Centrale University Health Authority ('ASUFC') for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(f), 9, 25, and 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the receipt of a complaint.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complaint, employees of a hospital belonging to ASUFC, where the complainant worked, had accessed the IT platfoRm that was used by ASUFC to process patients' health dataÂ without this access being justified by therapeutic and/or clinical needs. In addition, the Garante noted that the configuration of the IT platform for storing health data used by ASUFC's facilities allowed healthcare personnel to access personal data relating to any patient who was physically present in the health company at that time and, after declaring the existence of certain circumstances, also to patients not present in ASUFC's healthcare facility.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, as a result of the investigation carried out, the Garante found that access to patients' data in ASUFC's healthcare facility had been always allowed to employees, which did not ensure that only healthcare personnel who was actually treating a certain patient could access their personal data, in violation of the basic principles under Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(f), 9, and 25 of the GDPR.
In addition, the Garante explained that the IT platform used by ASUFC did not provide for a system for detecting anomalies,Â aimed at identifying anomalous behaviour or risk relating to the data processing performed by the employees (e.g. relating to the number of accesses performed, type or time frame of the same), constituting unauthorised and unlawful processing of personal data, resulting in ASUFC violating Article 32 of the GDPR.
In light of the established facts, the Garante imposed administrative fines on ASUFC for a total of â‚¬70,000.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fines, and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that ASUFC has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed and that, within the same timeframe, it may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

In its decision, the Garante outlinedÂ that, pursuant to Article 17(3) of the GDPR, Gedi was not required to delete the article, finding thatÂ freedom of information prevailed over the right to be forgotten in this case, in consideration of the social utility of the article in question.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 29 September 2021, its decision in case No. 355, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬30,000 to GEDI News Network S.p.A., for violations of Article 5(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), Articles 137(3) and 139 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to the GDPR ('the Code'), and Articles 6 and 10 of the Code of Ethics Relating to the Processing of Personal Data in the Exercise of Journalistic Activity ('Code of Ethics').
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that it had received a complaint on 23 December 2020, concerning the publication by GEDI News Network of a news article containing personal data of the complainant, who was severely injured at work, including identification data, details on the criminal trial related to the incident, and details on the compensation paid to him by the employer's insurance. Â 
In addition, the Garante outlined that it had invited GEDI News Network to submit its comments, following which the Garante had notified, on 11 June 2021, GEDI News Network of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of measures pursuant to Article 58(2) of the GDPR.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, the Garante found that the news article in question did not comply with Articles 137(3) and 139 of the Code, nor with Articles 6 and 10 of the Code of Ethics, observing, among other things, that the articleÂ contained unnecessary and excessive personal data of the complainant, which exposed their story to the attention of the public. As such, the Garante considered that compliance with the aforementioned provisions is an essential condition for the lawfulness and fairness of the processing of personal data, and therefore, the processing of personal data in question was in breach of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR.
Given the above, the Garante considered it necessary to impose an administrative sanction. In determining the same, the Garante highlightedÂ that it took into consideration, as aggravating factors, the damage caused to the dignity and confidentiality of the complainant, the negative effects of the processing on his personal and patrimonial sphere, and the fact that GEDI News Network had already been involved in similar complaints before the Garante; and as mitigating circumstances, the need to balance the complainant's rights with the right to press and freedom of information, and the fact that the incident had been made public by the complainant on social media. Â 
Outcomes
The Garante imposed the abovementioned fine, forbade GEDI News Network from processing the complainant's personal data any further, and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.
Lastly, the Garante noted that GEDI News Network has the right to settle the dispute by paying, within 30 days, an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed, and to appeal the decision before the judicial authority within the same timeframe.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complaint, the high school had published, in a special section dedicated to teachers of the electronic register, a document relating to the final timetable for the school year 2020-2021, containing a reference, next to the complainant's name, to the benefits received by the same due to their disability.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, at the end of the investigation, the Garante found that the document in question contained detailed information about personal and family events or information linked to the specific employment relationship of other teachers (e.g. maternity leave due to serious pregnancy complications), and that such document had been published due to a human error.
Subsequently, the Garante specified that employees' personal data may not be disclosed to persons other than those who are party to the employment relationship or who are not entitled to process the same data, in their capacity of authorised personnel. Therefore, the Garante took the view that, although the document in question, in its full version and containing personal data, including data relating to the health of the data subjects, was mistakenly made available in a restricted access area of the high school's electronic register, the data contained therein was made available to a very wide range of unauthorised persons, namely all of the complainant's colleagues among the teaching staff. Thus, the Garante held that the high school had violated Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 6, and 9 of the GDPR, and Articles 2-
Given the above, the Garante imposed an administrative sanction on the high school, and in quantifying the same, it took into account, among other things, the fact that the violation was the result of a mere material error consisting in the publication of a file intended for internal use instead of the file in which the sensitive data had been redacted.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and highlighted that the high school has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. Lastly, the Garante noted that the high school may, within the same timeframe, lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that INAIL, a state body providing sickness benefits to people injured at work, had notified to the Garante of the occurrence of three data breaches which concerned an online portal managed by INAIL. Specifically, the Garate outlined that, according to the notifications, the data breaches involved the accessÂ by third parties, on different days, of information on users' accidents and occupational disease documentation.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, at the end of the investigation carried out, the Garante found that, on at least three occasions, the online portal had allowed some users to consult the accident and occupational disease files of other users and that in one case, the data breach occurred following the execution of an outdated version of the online portal, due to human error. As such, the Garante held that the incidents in question had led to unauthorised access to the personal data of users, including health data, in the context of processing activities carried out by INAIL in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest. In light of this, the Garante found INAIL in violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1)(e), and 9(2)(g) of the GDPR, as well as of Articles 2-
In addition, the Garante observed that INAIL processes particularly sensitive data relating to vulnerable data subjects; as such, and in line with the principle of accountability under the GDPR, it is required to adopt technical and organisational measures that ensure, on an ongoing basis, the confidentiality of the data processed, as well as the integrity of the related systems and services. Thereafter, the Garante highlighted that the above mentioned events had given rise to a breach of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the GDPR.
Based on the established facts, the Garante imposed an administrative sanction and in quantifying the same, it took into account, among others, the small number of data subjects affected and the fact that INAIL had fully cooperated in the course of the investigation.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the abovementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that INAIL may settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half the sanction imposed within 30 days, and that, within the same timeframe, it may lodge an appeal before the judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 6 October 2021, that it had issued a decision, on 16 September 2021, imposing a fine of â‚¬5,000 on the Institute for Blind People ArdizzoneÂ Gioeni ('the Institute')Â for multiple violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') in relation to the use of CCTV cameras.Â 
In particular, the decision highlights that the CCTV cameras covered the Institute's internal corridors, in which there was access to the shower rooms outside the guests' rooms, and that the images captured were transmitted in real time on the monitors in theÂ conciergeÂ area, with aÂ risk of being seen by unauthorised third parties. As such, theÂ GaranteÂ considered that such use of surveillance cameras could not be justified by generic security reasons, which would have been equally satisfied using less invasive measures, and that it damaged the personal sphere of the guests, finding that itÂ constitutedÂ a breach of the principle of data minimisation contained in Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR. Moreover, theÂ GaranteÂ stated that theÂ Institute had processed personal data in a manner that did not comply with the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, as it only provided information on the use of CCTV cameras after the investigation of theÂ GaranteÂ had started. Therefore, the InstituteÂ subsequently provided information on the processing not in accordance with the requirements established by data protection law, without adopting appropriate measures to inform the guests, resulting in a breach of Article 5(1)(a), 12(1), and 13 of the GDPR. Furthermore, theÂ GaranteÂ found that the personal data processing in question was in violation of Article 35 of the GDPR, as the Institute had not carried out a preliminarily Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA').Â 
Additionally, inÂ determiningÂ the amount of the fine, theÂ GaranteÂ took into accountÂ the fact that the violations occurred for a limited amount of time and that the CCTV cameras in the corridor had been deactivated during the investigation.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 30 June 2022, its Decision No. 202, as issued on 26 May 2022, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬100,000 on Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., a bank, for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(f), and 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the receipt of a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complaint, Intesa Sanpaolo had disclosed the complainant's bank activity report to their parent and that such data had later been produced in a case pending before a court. In addition, the Garante noted that, following a request for information, Intesa Sanpaolo had explained that the personal data in question had been communicated by an employee to the complainant's parent in good faith, since the parent had previously been authorised to operate on the complainant's bank account, based on their parental authority, until the complainant had reached 18 years of age.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, as a result of the investigation carried out, the Garante found the justifications brought by Intesa Sanpaolo to be insufficient, explaining that the exemption of good faith was not applicable, in line with established case law, according to which an error is relevant as a cause of exclusion of liability only when it is unavoidable, beingÂ when the circumstances of the case are such as to lead the infringer to the conviction that their actions were lawful, or if they had in any case done everything possible to comply with the law. Therefore, the Garante concluded that Intesa Sanpaolo, by disclosing personal data to an unauthorised third party,Â had breached Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(f), and 6 of the GDPR.
In light of the established facts, the Garante imposed an administrative fine.Â In quantifying the amount of the fine, the Garante, among other things, considered that Intesa Sanpaolo had already been the subject of a similar enforcement action in the past and that, in the case at hand, it had failed to prove that it had adequatelyÂ trained its employee in relation to the protection of financial data.

Background to the case
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above and based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that Intesa Sanpaolo, on the occasion of the settlement of an insurance policy other than the one relating to the complainant, communicated to two third parties, personal data relating to the complainant, who was the holder of another policy, and this occurred due to a material error made by the operator in charge of settling the file. Moreover, the Garante detailed that Intesa Sanpaolo became aware of the incident months after the event and only after the report made by the person concerned.Â 
Therefore, the Garante stated that the processing of personal data carried out by the company is therefore unlawful because was carried out in a manner inconsistent with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, and integrity and confidentiality, in breach of Article 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(f) of the GDPR.

In particular, the Garante outlined that, following various complaints and reports, it had found thatÂ the personal data that Iren processedÂ for its telemarketing activities had been obtained indirectly from a third-party source,Â Nethex Digital Merketing Srl, which in turn had acquired the data, as an independent data controller, from two additional companies. Furthermore, the Garante highlighted that these two latter companies had obtained the necessary consent from their customers for the telemarketing activities carried out by both themselves and by third parties, including Nethex, but that this consent did not extend to the transfer of customer data from Nethex to Iren.
Therefore, the Garante found that Iren, having failed to verify that all of its telemarketing activities were based on free, specific, and informed consent, was, among other violations,Â in breach ofÂ the principles of lawfulness, transparency and accountability.

In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant, upon receiving promotional SMSÂ for a service named 'Evo24', a trademark owned by OMNIA24 S.r.l., had exercised their right of access, inquiring, among other things, about the methods of collection of consent and the source of the data. In response to this, OMNIA24 had notified the complainant that it had proceeded with the deletion of their personal data, and informed that it had acquired the complainant's personal data from La Duomo, a company to which OMNIA24 outsourced marketing activities. As such, the Garante noted that the complainant had requested that La Duomo provide proof of its declaration of consent to the use of personal data for marketing purposes. As the complainant did not receive any reply from La Duomo nor any further information from OMNIA24, they had contacted the Garante.
Accordingly, the Garante detailed that OMNIA24 had communicated to the Garante that it had been assured by La Duomo that the marketing lists complied with data protection law. Thus, OMNIA24 denied any responsibility. In addition, the Garante reported that La Duomo had explained that it had correctly acquired the complainant's consent but was unable to provide any proof of the same nor any information on the source of the complainant's personal data.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante considered that neither OMNIA24 nor La Duomo had provided any clarifications on the respective responsibilities with regard to the data processing in question. However, according to the Garante, it was possible to infer that La Duomo acted as data controllerÂ with regard to the acquisition and sharing of personal data to third parties, which the Garante held took place without the consent of the data subject, thus breaching Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR and Article 130 of the Code. In addition, the Garante found that La Duomo had violated Articles 12 and 15 of the GDPRÂ by not responding to the complainant's request to access their personal data. Moreover, the Garante considered that La Duomo's failure to provide proof of compliance amounted to a violation of Article 5(2) and 24 of the GDPR.
Furthermore, in determining the amount of the fine, the Garante noted that it had taken into account as aggravating circumstances, among other things, the fact that La Duomo had not put in place any measure to ensure the lawfulness of the processing activities carried out and the complete lack of cooperation during the investigation. However, the Garante also considered as mitigating circumstances, among other things, the fact the La Duomo is a micro-enterprise and the absence of previous violations.
Besides the imposition of the fine, the Garante:
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante issued the aforementioned fine, and ordered that payment be received within 30 days. In addition, the Garante requested La Duomo to provide proof, within the same timeframe, of the measures adopted to implement the abovementioned orders, and reminded that an appeal against the decision may be lodged before the ordinary judicial authority within 30 days.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 3 October 2022, in its monthly newsletter, that it had issued, on 15 September 2022, its decision No. 304, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬100,000 on the Region of Lazio, for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(d), 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 24 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 679/2016) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant had received an invitation from the Local Health Authority of Rieti to participate in the cervical cancer screening programme, addressed to their daughter who had died in 1995.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, at the end of the investigation, the Garante ascertained that, in order to carry out the screening campaigns, local health authorities have been usingÂ a regional platform, which contains all the parameters necessary to generate the invitations for the screening programme. Based on this, the Garante found that the complainant's daughter was still regularly registered in the regional platform in question, although she had died some time ago.
Subsequently, the Garante determined that the Region had failed to comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency (Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR) and of accuracy of the data (Article 5(1)(d) of the GDPR), and had incorrectly identified the legal bases of the processing (Articles 6 and 9 of the GDPR) and the roles played by the persons who, for various reasons, process personal data through the regional platform (Article 24 of the GDPR). In this regard, the Garante noted that the Region, as the data controller, must ensure that the personal data it holds is accurate and, if necessary, updated, taking all reasonable measures to delete or rectify the information it uses in a timely manner. Separately, the Garante also found that the Region, when sending the screening invitation letters, had not correctly provided data subjects with the required information on the processing of their personal data (Articles 12, 13, and 14 of the GDPR).
In light of the established facts, the Garante imposed on the Region a fine of â‚¬100,000. Additionally, in quantifying the same, the Garante outlined that it had taken into account, among other things, the fact that the Region had already been sanctioned in the past.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and ordered the Region to correctly identify the roles, purposes, and legal bases of the processing, and to modify and integrate the information to be made available to the data subjects. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that the Region may lodge an appeal against the decision before the ordinary judicial authority within 30 days.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 10 February 2022, its decision in Case No. 47, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬3,500 to the Local Health Authority of Melegnano and Martesana, for violations of Articles 5(1)(f) and 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a personal data breach notified by the Local Health Authority to the Garante.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the notification, the Local Health Authority had disclosed a medical report, in paper form, to a person not authorised to receive it. Further to this, the Garante notified the Local Health Authority of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of enforcement actions, inviting the same to provide its defence briefs and to ask to be heard before the Garante.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, at the end of the investigation carried out and based on the elements acquired, the Garante found that the disclosure resulted from a human error, perpetrated by the employee in charge of enveloping the medical reports. Further to this, the Garante observed that information on the health conditions of a data subject may only be communicated to third parties on the basis of a valid legalÂ authorisation. Additionally, the Garante pointed out that, in any case, the Local Health Authority, as the data controller, was obliged to comply with the principle of integrity and confidentiality, according to which personal data must be processed in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, including protection, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Further to this, the Garante held that the disclosure of personal data in question constituted a breach of Articles 9 and 5(1)(f) of the GDPR.
In light of the violations occurred, the Garante imposed on the Local Health Authority an administrative sanction, and, in quantifying the same, it took into account, among others:
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that the Local Health Authority has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed and that, within the same timeframe, it may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 13 January 2022, its decision in Case No. 8, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬7,500 to the Local Health Authority of Frosinone, for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 12, and 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a reportÂ presented to the Garante.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante noted that the Local Health Authority had indicated on its institutional website that consent was the legal basis for the processing of personal data carried out in relation to medicalÂ treatments. Further to this, the Garante initiated a preliminary investigation.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, the Garante highlighted that in the course of the investigation and based on the documents presented by the Local Health Authority, it had found that the Local Health Authority's website contained fiveÂ information notices, and that each of them presented issues that went beyond those outlined in the initial report. Specifically, the Garante considered that multiple processing purposes were indicated in the information notices, such as those of medical treatment, and administrative and scientific research, but the relevant legal bases were not always indicated and that, where referred to, these legal bases were in any case erroneous or contradictory. For instance, the Garante outlined that the information notices indicated that consent of the data subjects was indispensable for access to treatment or in relation to the processing of data for related administrative purposes.
Moreover, the Garante determined that the information notices did not always indicate the personal data retention period, and that they contained reference to the right to data portability under Article 20 of the GDPR. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that one of the information notices indicated the Local Health Authority's legitimate interest as the legal basis of the processing, whereas the GDPR clearly establishes, in Article 6(1), that legitimate interest as legal basis does not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.
Considering the above, the Garante held that the Local Health Authority had violated the principle of transparency and the right of data subjects to receive, at the time of data collection, all the information referred to in Article 13 of the GDPR in a concise, clear, and intelligible form. As such, the Garante imposed an administrative sanction to the Local Health Authority and, in determining the amount of the same, took into account, among other things,Â that:
Lastly, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the abovementioned fine, and noted that the Local Health Authority has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. Within the same timeframe, the Local Health Authority may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 2 DecemberÂ 2021, its decision in Case No. 420,Â in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬5,000 to the Local Health Authority of Parma,Â for violations of Articles 5(1)(f) and 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a breach notification by the same.
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante stated that the decision follows from a breach notification by the Local Health Authority, highlighting that it had sent reports regarding screening of tumours of two different patients, containing personal data relating to health, to a third patient. Additionally, the Garante noted that the report was incorrectly sent to the third patient due to a clerical error in regards to the packaging.
Findings of the Garante
Notably, the Garante found that having incorrectly sent the personal data of a patient to a third patient meant that the company had processed sensitive personal data in the absence of a suitable legal basis, thereby violating Article 9 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the Garante held that the Local Health Authority had not complied with the principles of data protection, including integrity and confidentiality, according to which adequate technical and organisational measures must be in place to guarantee the security of personal data from unlawful processing, therefore violating Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR.
In assessing the amount of the fine to be imposed, the Garante considered the following factors:
Outcomes
Ultimately, the Garante imposed a fine ofÂ â‚¬5,000 onÂ the Local Health Authority for the aforementioned violations,Â and noted that the company has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed.

In light of the established facts, the Garante imposed an administrative fine, and in quantifying the amount of the same, it took into account mitigating factors, such as the accidental nature of the conduct, the absence of complaints from the data subjects concerned, and the timely intervention of the Local Health Authority to remedy the breach.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 10 March 2022, its decision in Case No. 85, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10,000 to the Local Health Authority Toscana Centro, for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(f), 9, and 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following two data breach notifications submitted by the Health Authority to the Garante.
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante reported that the Health Authority had notified two personal data breaches to the Garante concerning the delivery, on two occasions, of medical records to the wrong recipients, due to clerical errors. Further to this, the Garante noted that, based on the notifications and the assessments subsequently conducted, it had notified the Health Authority of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of enforcement measures.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above and based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that, in both cases, the Health Authority had communicated personal data, and in particular health data, to third parties in the absence of a suitable legal basis, thus breaching the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and integrity and confidentiality, as well as Articles 9 and 32 of the GDPR.
Subsequently, the Garante, based on the nature of the violations occurred, imposed an administrative fine on the Health Authority and, in quantifying the amount of the same, the Garante noted that it had taken into consideration, among others, the following aggravating and mitigating circumstances:
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and considered that, in both cases, the Health Authority had declared that the medical records erroneously delivered to third parties had promptly been withdrawn and that the recipients, at the time of the returningÂ of the medical reports, had issued statements in which they excluded any further processing operations. As such, the Garante outlined that the conditions for the adoption of further measures, as provided for in Article 58(2) of the GDPR, were not met.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 10 September 2021, its decision to fine the Region of Lombardy â‚¬200,000 for publishingÂ personal data of more than 100,000 students on the institutional website, who had requested state scholarships or economic subsidies for the purchase of textbooks, technological equipment, and teaching tools. In particular, the Garante highlighted, that taking into account the fact that in order to benefit from the scholarship students must have Equivalent Economic Situation Indicator ('ISEE') of less than â‚¬15,000Â and the financial benefit of the scholarship is relatively minimal (â‚¬1,000), the effect of the disclosure was to reveal the economic hardship of the students in question. In addition, the Garante found that the data had been published in the absence of a suitable legal basis, in violation of Article 6 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and that the publication of the data revealing economic hardship breached the principles of lawfulness and data minimisation under Articles 5(1)(a) and (c) respectively.Â

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 29 September 2021, a decision, issued on 16 September 2021, to fineÂ Luigi Bocconi University â‚¬200,000 for using Respondus, a US proctoring app used toÂ invigilate examinations remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, for various violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Garante outlined that students were not sufficiently informed ofÂ the processing of theirÂ personal data carried out through the proctoring software, including failing to mentionÂ theÂ tracking of students' behaviour during the test (including face position and disconnections from the internet network, among other things),Â the subsequent processing by profiling, the audio-video recording of the test, and the photograph taken by the system at the beginning of the test, therefore violating Article 5(1)(a), 12 and 13 of the GDPR. In addition, in consideration of, among others things, the plethora of information collected on students during the examinations, which exceeded what was strictly necessary for the purposes of the examinations, both the principles of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) and of Data Protection by Design and by Default under Article 25 of the GDPR had been breached. Additionally, the Garante identified shortcomings in relation to University's obligation to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA'), notably in terms of the proportionality and necessity of the processing carried out by Respondus, in violation of Article 35 of the GDPR.
Furthermore, the Garante found that the processing of biometric data carried out through the Respondus application had been carried out without a suitable legal basis, in violation of Article 9 of the GDPR. More specifically, the Garante outlined that the University had identified consent as the appropriate legal basis, but in light of the imbalance of power between students and the University, consent could not be relied upon in these circumstances.
Notably, the Garante also identified violations with respect to the transfer of data to Respondus,Â a company established in the US, which processes the personal data in question as a data processor, on the basis of a processing agreementÂ under Article 28 of the GDPR. Referencing the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU') inÂ 
In the calculation of the fine amount, the Garante notably outlined that it had favourably considered, firstly, that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the University had to make choices and adopt technical and organisational measures quickly in order to ensure the continuity of the teaching activities and the conduct of exam sessions, and secondly, that the consequences of the principles of law from the Schrems II Case areÂ complex to implement, and,Â more generally,Â that the legal framework on international transfers is still evolving.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant, despite having expressed to Made in Italy, during an initial telemarketing call, their opposition to receiving further calls, had been contacted again for marketing purposes. Further to this, the Garante noted that the complainant had requested Made in Italy to communicate the source of the complainant's personal data and to delete the same. In addition, the Garante outlined that the complainant had objected to the processing of their personal data for marketing purposes. However, the Garante explained that Made in Italy never responded to the complainant's requests.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 13 January 2022, its decision in case No. 9, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬14,000 to
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante stated that the press report had highlighted a vulnerability in the system for acquiring and managing COVID-19 test data. Specifically, the Garante outlined that the media report had noted that third parties could gain access to certain personal data (including the name, surname, and mobile phone number) of the patients of the Regional Health Authority, through the use of the app 'Smart4You', which facilitates the reading of QR codes on the card issued to anyone who had undergone screening for COVID-19, in order to consult their medical file. In addition, the Garante stated that, according to the press report, QR codes were not created randomly, and instead followed a simple progressive criterion, so that by changing one digit, it was possible to access someone else's profile.
Subsequently, the Garante noted that the data protection officer of the Regional Health Authority had notified the Garante of the breach pursuant to Article 33 of the GDPR. Based on the notification and additional information received from the Regional Health Authority, the Garante notified the same of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative sanction.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, in the course of the subsequent investigation, the Garante found that the QR codes provided to patients who had undergone COVID-19 testing were indeed generated through sequential coding, with a direct association between the patient and the swab result, allowing access to another patient's profile and personal data by changing one digit. Moreover, the Garante found that the Regional Health Authority had also used a service, available on a screening management platform, which allowed the decodification of individuals' tax codes, thus provided access to names, surnames, and mobile phone numbers. Furthermore, the Garante noted that the Regional Health Authority used SMS messages to communicate to patients the results of COVID-19 tests. The Garante further outlined that the SMS messages in question contained details of the type of tests carried out and their outcome, rather than solely informing the patients of the availability of a medical report, as established by the Garante's Guidelines of 19 November 2009 on online medical reports. Moreover, the Garante determined that the data processing activities in question required the Regional Health Authority to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') prior to their commencement, which the Regional Health Authority had failed to do.
In light of the above, the Garante found that the Regional Health Authority's failure to adopt more complex encryption, the possibility of decoding a patient tax code, the use of SMS messages to communicate the results of COVID-19 tests, as well as the failure to carry out a DPIA resulted in the violation of Articles 5(1)(f), 32, and 35 of the GDPR, and Article 75 of the Code.
In light of the violations which occurred, the Garante imposed a fine, and in quantifying the same, the Garante took into account, among other things, the fact that the processing in question involved sensitive personal data. In addition, the Garante considered favourably the cooperation of the Regional Health Authority, the prompt adoption of measures to remedy the violations, and the fact that the violations had occurred in the context of a public health emergency due to COVID-19. Moreover, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the fine of â‚¬14,000 and highlighted that the Regional Health Authority has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. In addition, the Garante noted that the Regional Health Authority may, within the same timeframe, lodge an appeal before the judicial authority.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante noted that the nursing home had notified the Garante of a data breach in connection with a cyber-attack issued by a hacker group, which resulted in the publication of radiological images attributable to the nursing home's patients on the hackers' Twitter profile. Further to this, the Garante reported that MED Store Saronno was the administrator of the system in relation to which the incident had occurred, which was introduced by the nursing home to allow doctors to access diagnostic tests remotely.Â 
Findings of the Garante
Further to this, as a result of the investigation carried out, the Garante highlighted that MED Store Saronno, as the data processor, had violated its security obligations, in light of the unsafe network protocols used and the failure to define a password policy, which had resulted in the use of default passwords. Specifically, the Garante outlined that not only data controllers, but data processors too are required, under the GDPR, to adopt technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
As such, the Garante considered that the articles violated required the imposition of a monetary penalty. In determining the amount of the same, the Garante took into account, among other things, the fact that the incident appeared to have been isolated and determined by malicious behavior of a third party. In addition, the Garante considered favourably that MED Store Saronno had intervened prompty, recommending the nursing home to activate protected protocols and to replace the passwords used.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante issued the aforementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. In addition, the Garante ordered that the payment should be received within 30 days, noting that MED Store Saronno has the right to lodge an appeal before the judicial authority, within the same timeframe.

In particular, the Garante outlined that from 2017 to 2019 it had received hundreds ofÂ complaints from regarding promotional calls carried out on behalf ofÂ TIM s.p.a.Â from data subjects who in some cases had not provided their consent, and in other cases where the data subjects were listed in the public do-not-call registry, whilst there were also instances where data subjects had exercised their right to object and still received contact.
Specifically with regards to Mediacom, the Garante found that the company had contacted a total of 15,410Â telephone numbers without consent nor under any legal basis. In addition, the Garante found that Mediacom had failed to verify the lawfulness of the data contained in the contact lists purchased from third-party companies, and that wording of the consent formsÂ for its marketing activities was inadequate. However, the Garante outlined that it had taken into consideration the fact that during the investigation Mediacom had implemented measures to ensure future compliance, including the appointment of a data protection officer and a general review ofÂ of its commercial strategy and privacy policy.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 29 September 2021, its decision in case No. 358, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬2,000 to a medical practitioner, for violations of Article 5(1)(a) and 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the submission of a complaint.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante outlined that the complainant had lamented that the medical practitioner had communicated their personal data to the national marketing advisor and product business consultant of an unnamed company, whose products the medical practitioner had recommended to the complainant.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, based on the defence briefs presented, the Garante considered that the complainant had visited the medical practitioner and was, therefore, a patient, may reveal their health status and, consequently, constitute health data. Further to this, the Garante stated that, while consent is not required for personal data processing necessary for the provision of health treatment carried out by a health professional pursuant to Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR, the processing in question was carried out for the purpose of proposing the purchase of products, and therefore required the explicit consent of the complainant as provided by Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR. Additionally, the Garante noted that, in any case, the medical practitioner was in breach of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR as it did not process the complainant's personal data in a lawful, fair, and transparent manner.
Furthermore, in determining the amount of the penalty, the Garante highlighted that it took into consideration, among other things, the fact that the medical practitioner only communicated the complainant's personal data to one recipient and that it had fully cooperated with the Garante. However, in consideration of the violations occurred, the Garante also ordered the publication of the decision on the medicial practitioner's website as an ancillary sanction.
Outcomes 
Given the above, the Garante deemed necessary to impose the aforementioned fine, and ordered that payment be received within 30 days. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that the medicial practitioner has the right to to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the penalty imposed and the right to lodge a complaint with the judicial authority within 30 days.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante stated that the complainant had requested Medicina & Lavoro, which had been appointed by the complainant's employer to carry out mandatory health checks, to obtain a copy of their personal data stored in its archives. In addition, the Garante outlined that the complainant had statedÂ that they had not received an appropriate response. Moreover, the Garante highlighted that the complainantÂ had subsequentlyÂ submitted a new request to exercise their right of access, to which, however, they did not receive any response at all.
Further to the above, the Garante notified Medicina & Lavoro of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative fine, considering that the same had repeatedly failed to provide the complainant with appropriate information, also after the Garante had intervened requesting Medicina & Lavoro to provide a response to the complainant's request.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante held that the initial response provided by Medicina & Lavoro, with which the same had generically indicated the means by which the complainant could obtain a copy of the medical file subject to payment of a fee, as well as Medicina & Lavoro's failure to provide any response to the second request submitted by the complainant, did not comply with Articles 12(3) and 15 of the GDPR.
In light of the violations that occurred, the Garante imposed a fine, and in quantifying the same, the Garante took into account, on the one hand, the relevance of the violation, the fact that the same continued for a long period of time, and that Medicina & Lavoro responded to the complainant solely after the intervention of the Garante; on the other hand, the Garante considered favourably the absence of previous violations and the cooperation provided by Medicina & Lavoro during the investigation. In addition, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and order, and highlighted that Medicina & Lavoro has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed.

In particular, the Garante noted that MISE had failed to appoint a DPO by the established deadline, as well as that its investigation had shown that a list of managers and their CVs, including personal data, such as names, mobile numbers, and tax codes, had been published on MISE's website. Further to such findings, the Garante highlighted that there was no adequate legal basis for the online publication of said data, as well as that there were less intrusive methods to ensure that companies would have access to the managers' consultancy services, such as ensuring restricted access to said information through the use of passwords and usernames. As such, the Garante found that the dissemination of the CVs also constituted disproportionate processing of personal data.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complaint, the complainantÂ had participated in anÂ internal exam for the recruitment of navy marshals, and that, further to this, a report had been drawn up, to which was attached a copy of an email sent by the Directorate General for Military Personnel to the commission responsible for conducting the exam in question, containing a request for a medical assessment of the complainant, with an indication of the diagnosis. Separately, the Garante presented that the navy headquarters where the complainant was serving, had forwarded to an unauthorised individual, an email received from the Chancellery of the Military Court of Naples, containing a full statement of opposition proposed by the public prosecutor, concerning a military criminal judgment issued against the complainant.
Findings of the Garante
As a result of the investigation, the Garante determined that communicating the complainant's personal data, including health data and data related to criminal convictions and offences, to unauthorised persons without a legal basis, had resulted, in both instances, in the disclosure of personal data to third parties,Â in breach of Articles 5(1)(a), 6, 9, and 10 of the Regulation, as well as Articles 2-
In light of the nature of the violations occurred, the Garante imposed an administrative fine and, in quantifying the amount of the same, it took into account, among other things, the fact that the conduct in question involved the processing of particularly sensitive personal data.

Lastly, the Garante highlighted that the Ministry has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed and that, within the same timeframe, it may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 1 December 2020, that it had published, in its monthly newsletter, a decision fining the Ministry of Interior â‚¬50,000 for violating Articles 3(1)(a) and (d) and 4(3), in combination with Article 12(1), of Legislative Decree 18 May 2018, No. 51, implementing the Data Protection Directive with respect to Law Enforcement (Directive (EU) 2016/680). In particular, the Garante outlined, in its order of 29 October 2020, that a police headquarter shared with different offices a warning measure against a data subject containing inaccurate personal information. In addition, the Garante highlighted that although theÂ data subject had requested the rectification ofÂ the document,Â the document had been rectified only after the initiation of the Garante's formal proceeding.
The Garante noted that the fact that the police headquarter rectified the personal data within the data processing centre of the Department of Public Security was not sufficient, and that it should have rectified the same within the communication with the offices with which it shared the documentation. In its concluding remarks, the Garante ordered that, in addition to the fine, the Ministry of Interior must evaluate and promote the adequate training of data protection toÂ personnel, respect the rights of parties, rectify inaccurate data in a timely manner, and report the outcome of the assessment to the Garante within 180 days.Â

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 11 May 2022, in its monthly newsletter, its decision in Case No. 62, as issued on 24 February 2022, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬50,000 to the Ministry of Interior, for violations of Article 3(1)(a) of Legislative Decree No. 51 of 18 May 2018, Implementation of Data Protection Directive with respect to Law Enforcement (Directive (EU) 2016/680) ('Legislative Decree No. 51/2018'), following complaints submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante noted that the complainant had notified the Garante the publication, by various news outlets, of photographs portraying the complainant, allegedly disclosed to the press by an unnamed Police precinct. In particular, the Garante explained that the photographs in question consisted of mug shots, from which the complainant was fully identifiable, and frames from video surveillance cameras located within the Police precinct. Additionally, the Garante outlined that, according to the complaint, the photographs were published by news outlets in conjunction with articles that included the complainant's personal data and provided details on a criminal proceeding in which the complainant was involved.
Given the above, the Garante noted that it had launched an investigation and sent the Ministry and the Police precinct a request for information.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante outlined that, during the investigation carried out, it was not possible to identify any police need that could justify the disclosure to the press of the photographs portraying the complainant nor their personal details, and took the view that the processing was not only unnecessary, but also excessive in relation toÂ police purposes, especially due to the fact that the complainant was already in detention at the time of the disclosure of the photographs.
As such, the Garante found that the dissemination of the images in question was not in line with the principles laid down by the European Court of Justice and the Court of Cassation and were in breach of Articles 3(1)(a), 3(1)(c), and 5 of Legislative Decree No. 51/2018 and Article 14 Presidential Decree No. 15 of 15 January 2018, concerning the protection of personal data in relation to the processing of data carried out for police purposes by police bodies, offices, and commands.
Further to this, the Garante imposed an administrative fine, noting, however, that the issuance of the same wasÂ solely based on the violation of Article 5(1)(a) of Legislative Decree No. 51/2018. In quantifying the amount of the administrative fine, the Garante explained that it took into account, among other things, the particular nature of the data in question, i.e. images referring to a person in detention, in connection with criminal proceedings in which they were involved.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and highlighted that the Ministry has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. Lastly, the Garante outlined that, within the same timeframe, the Ministry may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 11 May 2022, in its monthly newsletter, its decision in Case No. 61, as issued on 24 February 2022, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬60,000 to the Ministry of Interior, for violations of Article 3(1)(a) of Legislative Decree No. 51 of 18 May 2018, Implementation of Data Protection Directive with respect to Law Enforcement (Directive (EU) 2016/680) ('Legislative Decree No. 51/2018'), following a notification to the Garante further to a judicial proceeding.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante observed that it had been notifiedÂ of the publication, on various websites and newspapers, of a video and images, showing the State Police's logo, showing arrest operations carried out by an unnamed Police precinct against eight suspects (including the complainant), allegedly responsible for a number of offences. Given the above, the Garante noted that it had launched an investigation and sent the Ministry a request for information.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante found that the video in question contained close-ups of the individuals under arrest, with their names under each image. Additionally, the Garante noted that the video in question had been available on Facebook and YouTube for a period of 5 years.
Subsequently, the Garante outlined that, in the light of national and EU legislation, and of the jurisprudence of the Court of Cassation and of the European Court of Human Rights, the images were in substance similar to mug shots, due to the characteristics of the framing and the presence of the logo of the State Police, noting that the publication of mug shots is allowed only for justice and police purposes or reasons of public interest. However, the Garante found that in the case in question, there was no need to disclose the images, nor the additional details provided to the press. Thus, the Garante took the view that the Police precinct had carried out an unnecessary, excessive, and detrimental data processing, which affected the dignity of the data subjects involved. As such, the Garante found the dissemination of the video and images in question in breach of Articles 3(1)(a), 3(1)(c), and 5 of Legislative Decree No. 51/2018 and Article 14 of Presidential Decree No. 15 of 15 January 2018, concerning the protection of personal data in relation to the processing of data carried out for police purposes by police bodies, offices, and commands.
Further to this, the Garante imposed an administrative fine, noting, however, that the issuance of the same is solely based on the violation of Article 5(1)(a) of Legislative Decree No. 51/2018. In quantifying the amount of the administrative fine, the Garante explained that it took into account the particular nature of the data in question (i.e. images of data subjects under arrest) and the duration of the processing.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and highlighted that the Ministry has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. Lastly, the Garante outlined that, within the same timeframe, the Ministry may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

In 2017, the GaranteÂ launched anÂ investigation intoÂ MoVimento 5 Stelle and Associazione Rousseau, following a data breach involving personal data of members and supporters of the political party stored on their online platform Rousseau. Following the investigation, the GaranteÂ issued aÂ decision, onÂ 21 December 2017, in which it ordered them to adoptÂ several securityÂ measuresÂ in relation to authentication, cryptography and internet protocols and auditing, as well as information requirements under the Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC).
In 2018, the Garante carried out new inspectionsÂ and found that although there had been an improvement in the level of data security, the prescriptions had not been completely implemented. In particular, the Garante found, shortcomings in the use of obsolescent softwares, failures to implement systems that would create audible events for certain accesses and interactions with information systems and the assignment of user roles and privileges. In addition, the Garante established that the e-voting system used by the platform did not guarantee the integrity, authenticity and secrecy of votes, due to the lack of appropriate auditing procedures.

In particular, the Garante outlined that, following aÂ complaint presented by an employee who, during a disciplinary procedure, had discovered that he had been constantly monitored, it had found that the Municipality had been using, for about ten years, a control and filtering system for the internet browsing of employees, with data retention for one month and the creation of specific reports, for network security purposes.Â In addition, the Garante highlighted that theÂ Municipality had failed toÂ adequately informÂ employees of the monitoring system, and hadÂ carriedÂ out preventive and generalised collection of data relating to connections to websites visited by individual employees, which was disproportionate to the purpose of processing.Â 
In addition, the Garante outlined that during its investigation, it had also identifiedÂ violations of Articles 5(1)(a) and 9 of the GDPR with respect to processing of data carried out by the Municipality relating to its internal procedure for the use of the psychological assistance service. Specifically, the Garante found that the form used forÂ the procedure provides for the compilation of the form called 'Request for an extraordinary medical examination' which had to be signed off by the employee's manager, thus constituting unlawful processing of health data.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante noted that, according to the complaint,Â the Municipality had published,Â on the online notice board of itsÂ institutional website, a resolution concerning the transfer of local police officers to another municipality. More specifically, the Garante outlined that, despite the fact that the complainant was not involved in the transfer, the resolution expressly stated their name, professional qualification, and numerous references to the fact that the complainant had lodged complaints and lawsuits against one of the police officers to whom the resolution was addressed.
Additionally, the Garante stated that it had invited the Municipality to provide its comments on the facts in question, and that subsequently it had notified the Municipality of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative sanction.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, and based on the Garante's investigation, the Garante rejected the Municipality's view that the publication of the complainant's personal data was justified on the basis of the legal provisions on the publication of the acts of local authoritiesÂ and on the obligation, imposed on the same, to state reasons for the administrative acts adopted. In addition,Â the Garante determined that, even in the presence of a possible legal provision requiring the publication, by the public administration, of certain acts and documents, the Municipality should have, in any case, complied with the basic principles of data protection, including the principle of lawfulness, necessity, and data minimisation. Additionally, the Garante considered that the need to provide adequate reasons for the adoption of certain measures does not imply that the full version of the relevant act should be made available to the public.Â Therefore, the Garante held thatÂ the publication of the resolution in a redacted form would not have in any way hindered the Municiplaity's ability to comply with its obligations.Â As such, the Garante held that the Municipality had processed the complainant's personal data in the absence of a suitable legal basis and in breach of the basic principles of the processing.
Given the nature of the violations in question, the Garante imposed a fine and, in quantifying the same, took into account, on one hand, the fact that the events in question occurred despite the numerous guidelines issued by the Garante to assist public administrations.Â However,Â on the other hand, the Garante considered favourably that the Municipality had promptly taken steps to remedy the violation and mitigate its possible negative effects and that it had cooperated fully during the investigation. In addition, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.

In conclusion, the Garante imposed the above-mentioned fine and order, and indicated that the Municipality has 30 days to lodge an appeal before the judicial authority.

Further to the above, at the end of the investigation carried out, the Garante determined that the Municipality had processed, through Amiu, personal data by means ofÂ CCTV cameras, without providing the data subjects with prior information on the processing, with a consequent breach of the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and Articles 12, 13, and 14 of the GDPR. Moreover, the Garante found that the Municipality had failed to regulate the relationship with Amiu, which operated as the data processor, ahead of the processing operations, in breach of Article 28 of the GDPR. Lastly, the Garante observed that the Municipality had failed to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA'), which would have been warranted under Article 35 of the GDPR.
Given the established facts, the Garante imposed an administrative sanction on the Municipality, and, in quantifying the same, it took into account, among others, the fact that the Municipality, at the time of the decision being issued, had not yet adopted adequate measures to ensure compliance with the GDPR.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and further required the Municipality to comply with the following orders, within 30 days:
Lastly, the Garante highlighted that the Municipality has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed and that, within the same timeframe, it may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 27 JanuaryÂ 2022, its decision in Case No. 22, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬1,000 to Musicraiser S.r.l., for violations of Articles 21(2), 21(4), and 21(5) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual to the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg data protection authority ('LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg').
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, following the complaint presented to the LfDI Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the Garante had been identified as the lead supervisory authority, considering that the case concerned a cross-border data processing and that Musicraiser had a single establishment in Italy. Specifically, the Garante outlined that the complainant had lamented the continued receipt, following their registration to the web platform of Musicraiser, of a newsletter, despite the numerous requests for deletion sent to the same.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, at the end of the investigation carried out, the Garante found Musicraiser in violation of Articles 21(2), 21(4), and 21(5) of the GDPR, for repeatedly sendingÂ its newsletter to the complainant's email address,Â despite the complainant's objections.
Based on the established facts, the Garante imposed an administrative sanction and, in quantifying the amout of the same, it took into account, among other factors,Â that:

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 26 May 2022, its Decision No. 195, as issued on 26 May 2022, in which it issued a fine of â‚¬12,000 on the Naples Municipal Police Corps, for violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 6, and 88 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/679) ('GDPR') and Article 113 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('the Code'), following a report from a trade union organisation.
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante highlighted that the Naples Municipal Police requested personal information from employees, including, among other things, names, surnames, addresses, and mobile phone numbers, for the purpose of COVID-19 checks, despite the relevant data not containing health information. Further, the relevant employee data of the Naples Municipal Police was then provided to the Naples Health Department.
Findings of the Garante 
Further to the above, the Garante found that in the context of collecting personal data, related to preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the Naples Municipal Police, the Naples Municipal Police is not allowed to collect directly from interested parties even with employees' consent. This owes to the impossibility of considering the consent of employees as a valid condition of lawfulness for the processing of personal data, taking into account the imbalance of powerÂ between the employer and employee, especially when the employer is a public authority.
In addition, the Garante found that despite the processing of personal data, nominally occurring to prevent the spread of COVID-19, there was no legal basis for such processing.
Accordingly, the Garante found that the collection and subsequent processing of employees' personal data by the Naples Municipal Police, violated Articles 5(1)(a), 6, and 88 of the GDPR, and Article 113 of the Code.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine, though outlining that the Naples Municipal Police has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 13 January 2022, its decision in Case No. 7, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬1,000 to
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante stated that the complainant had lamented the publication, on the Local Health Authority's website, of a press release containing their personal data relating to their employment relationship and the adoption of disciplinary measures against them. Subsequently, the Garante noted that it had notified the Local Health Authority of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative sanction, inviting the same to present its defence briefs or to ask to be heard before the Garante.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante determined that, contrary to what the Local Health Authority had claimed, the fact that the complainant had issued statements to the press concerning the same facts to which the disciplinary measures taken against the complainant referred, could not justify the dissemination of the complainant's personal data on the Local Health Authority's institutional website. In fact, the Garante clarified that public entities may disclose personal data only if allowed by law or regulation, regardless of whether the same data has already been disclosed elsewhere, including by the data subject, for other purposes. In addition, the Garante highlighted that, in any case, the statements made by the complainant to the press predated the disciplinary measures, so that the publication of the press release entailed the dissemination of personal data other than that relating to the complainant's statements to the press.
As such, the Garante held that the dissemination on the institutional website of the Local Health Authority of the complainant's personal data, as well as that of another employee, violated the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and lacked a suitable legal basis.
In light of the violation occurred, the Garante imposed a fine, and in quantifying the same, the Garante took into account, on one hand, the fact that the violations took place despite the numerous guidelines issued by the Garante to public entities, and the considerable period of time during which the complainant's personal data remained visible on the Local Health Authority's website; on the other hand, the Garante considered favourably, among other things, the fact that the violations did not concern sensitive data, and that the Local Health Authority had promptly removed the press release in question.Â 
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine, and highlighted that the Local Health Authority has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. In addition, the Garante noted that the Local Health Authority may, within the same timeframe, lodge an appeal before the judicial authority.Â Moreover, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 10 February 2022, its decision in Case No. 46, in which it issued a fine of â‚¬6,000 to the National Institute of Statistics, for violations of Articles 5(1)(f)Â and 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a notification of a personal data breach made by the National Institute of Statistics to the Garante.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante noted that the National Institute of Statistics had notified the Garante of a personal data breach pursuant to Article 33 of the GDPR, and outlined that, according to the notification,Â the breach consisted in an IT attack that had resulted in the exfiltration of certain information and potential unauthorised access by third parties to the information, including authentication credentials, contained, respectively, in the 'COEWEB' and 'INDATA' portals that could be reached via the National Institute of Statistics'Â website. More specifically, the Garante reported that, according to the notification, the breach involved:
Additionally, the Garante outlined that, following the notification, the National Institute of Statistics had carried out further in-depth checks, and concluded that the incident involving the INDATA portal did constitute a security incident, but not a personal data breach, and that the risk that personal data had actually been exfiltrated from the COEWEB portal was very low.
Moreover, the Garante stated that it had communicated to the National Institute of Statistics the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrativeÂ sanction, inviting the same to submit its comments and observations.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the GaranteÂ determined that, although no data was extracted from the INDATA portal and although the incident in the COEWEB portal was classified as low risk, it had been ascertained that the National Institute of Statistics, as the data controller and holder of large databases, which, by their very nature, are very likely exposed to attacks, did not have in place technical measures capable of guaranteeing, on a permanent basis, the security and confidentiality of the data processed therein. Specifically, the Garante highlighted that the National Institute of Statistics stored passwords in plain text or through an algorithm not robust enough, whereas the use of cryptographic techniques is one of the measures commonly adopted to protect the passwords of users of online services. In addition, the Garante found that the systems used were obsolete and the code of the portals contained some specific vulnerabilities.
Given the nature of the violations, the Garante imposed an administrative sanction and, in quantifying the same, took into account, among others, the following:
Moreover, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante issued the aforementioned fine, to be paid within 30 days, and indicated that the National Insititute of Statistics may, within the same timeframe, lodge an appeal before the judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 25 February 2021, its decision to fineÂ Gedi Gruppo Editoriale SpAÂ â‚¬20,000 for publishing photos in its newspaper of handcuffed individualsÂ in custody in connection with a murder without the consent of such individuals, in violation of Article 5(1)(a) of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('GDPR'), Article 137(3) of theÂ Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to General Data Protection Regulation ('the Code'), and Article 8 of the Ethical Rules relating to the Processing of Personal Data in the Exercise of Journalistic Activity ('the Rules').
In particular, the Garante outlined that Gedi had failed to comply with an order made on 25 October 2019Â to remove the photos from its website, cease further dissemination of the photos, and respond to the Garante within 15 days with the initiatives undertaken to remedy the violation. Furthermore, the Garante outlined aggravating factors in its calculation of the fine, which includedÂ the duration of the violation, the particular damage to the dignity of the concerned individuals, whilst mitigating factors included the need to balance the right to press and freedomÂ of information with the fundamental right to the protection of personal data of the interested parties, and the lack of any specific precedentsÂ to the particular facts of the case.Â

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 2 December 2021, its decision in case No. 422, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬30,000 toÂ Casa di cura Fondazione Gaetano e Piera Borghi di Angelo Borghi SRL., a private nursing home,Â for violations of Articles 5(1)(f)Â and 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a data breach notification submitted by the nursing home, and in conjunction with a 
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the nursing home notified to the Garante a data breach in connection with a cyber-attack issued by a hacker group, which resulted in the publication of radiological images of two of the nursing home's patients on the hackers' Twitter profile.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, following the above-mentioned notification, the Garante asked the nursing home to provide some further elements for the assessment of this personal data breach. In particular, the Garante found that the remote access to diagnostic examinations, a measure introduced as part of the measures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, could be accessed using default and not dedicated passwords, thus making the access to the personal data possible. Therefore, the Garante stated that the failure to use encryption tools for data transmission and access to that medical software, the absence of controls on the quality of the passwords used, the lack of measures for the compulsory modification of such passwords upon first use or, in any case, periodically, as well as the absence of mechanisms for the automatic blocking of users, did not comply with the provisions of Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 of the GDPR, in view of the nature of the data in question (health-related data) and the high risks arising from their possible acquisition by third parties.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine, to be paid within 30 days. In addition, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website, an ancillary sanction, and noted that the nursing home has 30 days to lodge an appeal.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 2 December 2021, its decision in case No. 424, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬100,000 to OMNIA24 srl, for violations of Article 5(1)(a), 5(2), 6(1)(a), 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, and 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and Article 130 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') ('the Code'), following a complaint submitted by an individual, and in conjunction with a 
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant, upon receiving promotional SMSÂ for a service named 'Evo24', a trademark owned by OMNIA24, had exercised their right of access, inquiring, among other things, about the methods of collection of consent and the source of the data. In response to this, OMNIA24 had notified the complainant that it had proceeded with the deletion of their personal data, and informed the complainant that it had acquired the complainant's personal data from La Duomo S.r.l.s., a company to which OMNIA24 outsourced marketing activities. As such, the Garante noted that the complainant had requested that La Duomo provide proof of its declaration of consent to the use of personal data for marketing purposes. As the complainant did not receive any reply from La Duomo nor any further information from OMNIA24, they had contacted the Garante.
Accordingly, the Garante detailed that OMNIA24 had communicated to the Garante that they had been assured by La Duomo that the marketing lists complied with data protection law. Thus, OMNIA24 denied any responsibility. In addition, the Garante reported that La Duomo had explained that it had correctly acquired the complainant's consent but was unable to provide any proof of the same nor any information on the source of the complainant's personal data.
Further to the above, the Garante added that it had also received similar complaints from other data subjects.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante considered that neither OMNIA24 nor La Duomo had provided any clarifications on the respective responsibilities with regard to the data processing in question. However, the Garante took the view that OMNIA24 acted as data controller, considering that the same determines the purpose and means of the processing as well it is the entity in whose interest the processing is carried out. In addition, the Garante held that the failure to qualify the roles in relation to the processing had led to a breach of the basic processing principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, since it did not appear that the necessary information had been provided to the complainant, such as to allow the the same to understand their respective responsibilities in the processing. Moreover, according to the Garante, OMNIA24's inadequate response to the complainant's request to access their personal data constituted a violation of Articles 5(1)(a),12, 13, 14, and 15 of the GDPR. Additionally, the Garante found that OMNIA24 had not adopted any precautions in entrusting the promotional service to La Duomo, thus failing to implement the required technical and organisational measures to guarantee and be able to demonstrate compliance, thus resulting in a violation of Article 5(2), 24, and 28 of the GDPR.
Also, the Garante took the view that the conduct described above lead to the sending of promotional messages without consent, integrating a violation of Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR and Article 160 of the Code.
Furthermore, in determining the amount of the fine, the Garante noted that it had taken into account as aggravating circumstances, among other things, the fact that OMNIA24 had not put in place any type of control over the activity of La Duomo and had not cooperated with the Garante during the investigation. However, the Garante also considered as mitigating circumstances, among other things, the absence of previous violations.
Besides the imposition of the fine, the Garante:
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante issued the aforementioned fine, and ordered that payment be received within 30 days. In addition, the Garante requested OMNIA24 to provide proof, within the same timeframe, of the measures adopted to implement the abovementioned orders, and reminded that an appeal against the decision may be lodged before the ordinary judicial authority within 30 days.

In particular, the Garante outlined that it had received two complaints regarding the receipt of various promotional communications sent via email from OneDirect without the data subject's consent. Furthermore, the Garante noted that the complainants had been unable to utlise the unsubscribe button present in the emails and that OneDirect had failed to respond to their requests to exercise their data subject rights.
As a result, the Garante held that OneDirect is prohibited from any further processing processing for promotional purposes of the data for which it is unable to document the existence of suitable consent. In addition, the Garante highlighted the importance of acquiring free, specific and prior consent from the interested parties before sending promotional communications using automated methods, as well as the need to inform the interested parties of the controller's contact details and how to exercise theirÂ rights.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the Police had carried out an administrative check at Finger, a restaurant located in Palermo, where it discovered the presence of a CCTV surveillance system, while no information on the same was available to data subjects.

Findings of the Garante
Moreover, the Garante found that OTTO had not provided data subjects with the required information on the presence of CCTV surveillance at Finger. Therefore, the Garante held that the personal data processing carried out violated Article 13 of the GDPR.
As such, the Garante outlined that, in determining the amount of the fine, it took into consideration, among other things, that OTTO had not cooperated with the Garante in the course of the procedure, nor had it demonstrated that it had fulfilled its obligation. However, the absence of specific precedents against OTTO relating to violations of the GDPR was considered favourably. In addition, the Garante ordered, in consideration of the type of violation ascertained, the publication of the decision on its website.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that it had initiated the investigation in question as part of a wider investigation plan concerning the processing of personal data acquired through whistleblowing systems. Specifically, the Garante stated that investigations were carried out into the Hospital and ISWEB, an IT company which provides and manages the whistleblowing application used by the Hospital. Further to this, the Garante specified that the former operated as data controller and the latter as data processor.
Additionally, the Garante outlined that at the end of the investigation, it had notified the Hospital the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of enforcement measures pursuant to Article 58(2) of the GDPR.
Findings of the Garante
Subsequently, the Garante found that the Hospital had processed the personal data of employees and other data subjects, through the use of the whistleblowing application, without informing the same in advance about the processing of personal data carried out for whistleblowing purposes, thus violating Articles 5(1)(a), 13, and 14 of the GDPR.
Moreover, the Garante observed that the whistleblowing web application used by the Hospital, based on open-source software, could be accessed through systems that, not having been properly configured, recorded and stored, within the logs of the firewall, users' browsing data, so as to allow the identification of the users, including the potential whistleblowers. As such, the Garante held that the Hospital had processed the personal data in a manner which was inconsistent with the principles of integrity and confidentiality, Data Protection by Design, and Data Protection by Default, in violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 25 of the GDPR, and in the absence of appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing, thus violating Article 32 of the GDPR.
In addition, the Garante determined that the Hospital had violated Article 30 of the GDPR, by failing to record in the register of processing activities the acquisition and management of whistleblowing reports, and Article 35 of the GDPR, by failing to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA').

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complaints related to the unauthorised publication of personal data (names, addresses, telephone numbers) on a website, the owner of which, following specific investigations, was identified to be Petta Fabio Giovanni. More specifically, the Garante outlined that the complainants had represented that they had never authorised the inclusion of their personal data on the abovementioned website, and that they had tried several times, with no success, to have their data deleted using a form available on the website. Additionally, the Garante reported that the complainants had indicated the absence, on the website, of any information that could identify the owner of the same and the data controller.
Further to this, the Garante explained that, in response to a request for clarification, Petta Fabio Giovanni did not document in any way the origin of the published data, and did not prove the deletion of the personal data requested by the complainants. Thereafter, the Garante noted that Petta Fabio Giovanni failed to further collaborate in the course of the investigation.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, as a result of the investigation carried out, the Garante found that Petta Fabio Giovanni had breached:
In light of the established facts, the Garante imposed an administrative fine. In quantifying the amount of the same, the Garante, while considering the mitigating factor of the economic size of Petta Fabio Giovanni, took into account certain aggravating circumstances, including the relevance and duration of the breaches, the large number of individuals whose data was published, and the negligence of Petta Fabio Giovanni.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 25 November 2021, its decision in case No. 411, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬30,000 to a physician for violations of Articles 5(1), 6, and 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by a patient.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complaint, the physician had shared with third parties, including the complainant's former employer, information relating to medical treatments undergone by the complainant, with the aim to obtain payment from the complainant for some overdue invoices in relation to health services provided by the physician. In addition, the Garante noted that, based on the information provided by the physician on the events in question, it had notified the same of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of the measures pursuant to Article 58(2) of the GDPR.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, as a result of the investigation carried out, the Garante considered that, contrary to the physician's claim, the information concerning the fact that the complainant had undergone medical treatment, in and of itself, constitutes health data. However, none of the conditions set out in Article 9(2) of the GDPR, which would have allowed the physician to overcome the general prohibition ofÂ the processing of sensitive data,Â had been met. In addition, the Garante took the view that the processing carried out by the physician was aimed at obtaining payment for the services provided, but the physician had not indicated in light of which legal basis, among those indicated in Article 6 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data in question would have been lawful. Moreover, the Garante highlighted that the personal data of the complainant had been shared with a third partyÂ after the complainant had terminated their employment relationship with the same. Considering the above, the Garante held that the personal data processing had been carried out in the absence of a suitable legal basis and in breach of the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.
Furthermore, the Garante, in determining the amount of the fine, took into account the fact that the violation was intentional and was likely to affect the reputation of the complainant, thus causing damages.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine, to be paid within 30 days. In addition, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website, an ancillary sanction, and noted that the physician has 30 days to lodge an appeal.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 9 June 2022,Â its Decision No. 214, in which it imposedÂ a fine of â‚¬26,000 on the Policoro MunicipalityÂ for violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(e), 5(2), 12, 13, 24, and 38(6) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint from an individual.
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante highlighted that the complainant had alleged that the Municipality had used video surveillance in violation of the regulations on the protection of personal data. In addition, the Garante added that the complainant alleged the inadequate installation of the signs informing the public of the deployment of video surveillance and the lack of adequate information on video surveillance contained therein.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante found that, in light of the investigation carried out, the Municipality had processed personal data through video surveillance whileÂ providing data subjects with insufficientÂ information on the processing, in violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 12, and 13 of the GDPR. In addition, the Garante explained that the Municipality had not set the maximum retention times for the images taken using cameras for the purpose of combating the practice of illegal waste abandonment.
Consequently, in view of the principle of accountability and in compliance with the storage limitation principle, the Garante held that the Municipality should have defined the maximum retention terms for video surveillance images for each processing purpose pursued, adequately describing the choices made in this regard.
As a result, the Garante considered that the processing of personal data carried out by the Municipality had been unlawful, as it had been not compliant with the principles of lawfulness, correctness, and transparency, storage limitation, and accountability, providing information on the processing of first-level personal data that was not adequate to inform the individuals.
Furthermore, the Garante found that the Municipality, by entrusting its data protection officer ('DPO') with the power to assist the Municipality in the proceedings before the Garante, had placed the same DPO in a position of conflict of interest, in violation of Article 38(6) of the GDPR.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine, also outlining that the Municipality has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed.Â 
Lastly, the Garante ordered the Municipality, within 30Â days of notification of the decision, to identify the maximum retention times of the images on the basis of the purposes pursued with the video surveillance system, and to provide interested parties with appropriate information on the processing of personal data.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 7 April 2022, its decision in Case No. 121, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬15,000 to Rebirth S.r.l., for violations of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and Articles 114 and 157 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to the GDPR ('the Code'), following a report by the Italian finance police.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante observed that it had been notified of the installation of a video surveillance system on the premises of the restaurant named 'CaffÃ¨ Antica Roma', managed by Rebirth and allegedly not compliant with the rules on the protection of personal data. Given the above, the Garante noted that it had sent the company a request for information, and that it had launched an investigation in the absence of a response from Rebirth.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante found that 14 cameras were installed in the restaurant, in the absence of any notice providing information on their presence. Additionally, the Garante noted that the video surveillance system had been installed without prior authorisation from the Labor Inspectorate and from the relevant trade union.
Subsequently, the Garante outlined that such processing of personal data by means of video surveillance was in breach of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13 of the GDPR. Pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR, the Garante noted that the data controller should have provided data subjects, prior to the start of the processing, with all information relating to the video surveillance.
Further to this, the Garante explained that, in the context of the employment relationship, the obligation to inform the employees about the presence of video surveillance in the workplace derives from Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR. In particular, the Garante took the view that such surveillance violated the principle of lawfulness of processing, according to which the processing is lawful if it complies with the applicable sector regulations. Indeed, the Garante recalled Article 114 of the Code, which provides further protection of rights and freedoms with regard to the processing of personal data of workers, and establishes that such processing of data must occur in accordance with Article 4 of Law No. 300 of 1970. Thus, the Garante considered that the processing of personal data carried out by Rebirth, having failed to comply with the aforementioned provision, was therefore unlawful.
Outcomes
As such, the Garante imposed an administrative fine of â‚¬15,000 on Rebirth. In quantifying the amount of the fine, the Garante explained that it took into account, as an aggravating factor, Rebirth's failure to reply to the request for information sent pursuant to Article 157 of the Code.
In conclusion, the GaranteÂ highlighted that Rebirth has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. Lastly, the Garante outlined that, within the same timeframe, Rebirth may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

In particular, the Garante outlined that Regione Lazio's failure to designate Capodarco as a data processor had led to the unlawful processing of personal data from 1999 to January 2019, asÂ Regione Lazio had allowedÂ Capodarco toÂ carryÂ out data processing operationsÂ in the absence of a suitable prerequisite of lawfulness.

In particular, the Garante outlined that journalists must refrain from using pressure and artifice to collect news that could be accessed through journalism instruments. More specifically, the Garante noted that journalists of the TV programme 'Le Iene' entered the office of a doctor pretending to have health conditions and recorded the dialogue without the doctor's consent, only partially covering their face and masking their voice. Moreover, the Garante highlighted that the journalists could have collected the same news through other means, such as an official interview, eventually anonymising their identity.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 11 February 2021, that it had fined Roma Servizi per la MobilitÃ  S.r.l, the designated data controller, â‚¬60,000 for failing to implement adequate technical and organisational security measures, regarding the data of citizens who had obtained permits to access and park in restricted traffic areas.

As a result, the decision outlines that Roma Servizi failed to implement that adequate security measures were in place, as required by Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').

In particular, the Garante outlined that, although the patient had, during a period of hospitalisation related to the termination of herÂ pregnancy, requested the masking of her medical report, the health authority had transmitted the report to a general practitioner due to a technical error.
Therefore, the Garante found that the disclosure of the patient's health data had constituted a violation of the principles of lawfulness and confidentiality under Articles 5(2)(a), 5(2)(f), andÂ 9 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('GDPR'). Furthermore, the Garante found that the technical error leading to the unlawful disclosure of patients' health data had affected a total of 48 individuals in the period from April 2018 and August 2019, which, among other factors, it took into consideration in the calculation of the financial penalty.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant had received several unsolicited promotional SMS and that they had been unable to fully exercise their right of access and right to object. More specifically, the Garante outlined that the promotional SMS identified B&T as the relevant organisation, and that, in the course of various discussions between the same and the complainant, B&T had claimed that it was not involved in the material sending of the promotional SMS, which were instead provided on its behalf by a third party, inviting the complainant to submit their request to a different email address. Subsequently, the Garante highlighted that the complainant had received a communication from the responsible marketing company, Aimon, which had indicated to the complainant that in the sending of the promotional SMS, it had used the data provided by a database supplier, which, Aimon claimed, was the data controller. However, the Garante stated that Aimon did not provide the complainant with any details regarding the identity of the database supplier, and solely informed the complainant that their request would be forwarded to Runwhip's email address.
Further to this, the Garante noted that it had notified the complaint to all the entities involved, i.e. B&T, Aimon, and Runwhip, asking them to provide their comments on the case in question. Subsequently, the Garante noted that Runwhip had not provided any response, not even after the request had been reiterated, and as such, the Garante had notified Runwhip of the initiation of the administrative procedure aimed at the adoption of the corrective and sanctioning measures provided for by Article 58(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), inviting Runwhip to present its defence briefs or to request to be heard before the Garante.
Findings of the Garante
Morever, the Garante highlighted that, in the course of the investigation, it had emerged, from documents submitted by Aimon, that the same and Runwhip had entered into an agreement providing that Runwhip would act as an intermediary between Aimon itself and the list provider, Blade Consulting Sagl, for the acquisition of a list of potential recipients of promotional activities. However, the Garante outlined that Runwhip's ongoing omissive behaviour did not make it possible to acquire a complete picture of the situation, thereby significantly aggravating the investigation.
In light of the above, the Garante found Runwhip in violation of Article 157 of the Code, which led to the adoption of a pecuniary administrative sanction.Â In determining the amout of the fine, the Garante took into consideration, among other things, the grossly negligent, andÂ even malicious, nature of the conduct, the failure to adopt measures to mitigate or eliminate the consequences of the violation, and the existence of a previous relevant violation. In addition, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the GaranteÂ imposed the aforementioned fine and noted that Runwhip has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the fine imposed, and may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority, within the same timeframe.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the Region had notified the Garante of a personal data breach consisting in the dissemination of the personal data of the candidates who had participated in the pre-selection phase of a public sector examination. In addition, the Garante reported that, according to the notification, one of the candidates had accidentally received an email with aÂ URL to a portal containing the personal data of all the candidates. Additionally, the Garante outlined that the email had been sent by Scanshare, which was the company responsible for the organisation and management of the pre-selection and in charge of the upload of the personal data of the candidates to the aforementioned online portal. Further to this, the Garante noted that it had also received numerous complaints from the candidates in relation to the aforementioned breach.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, at the end of the investigation carried out and based on the elements acquired, the Garante found that Scanshare had not adopted any suitable measure to ensure that the personal data of each data subject, as uploaded to the online portal, was made available exclusively to the same or to authorised persons. AsÂ such, the Garante held that the personal data breach had been mainly caused by Scanshare's failure to put in place adequate technical and organisational measures, and in particular specific access control measures, thus finding the same in breach of Article 32 of the GDPR.
Additionally, the Garante found that Scanshare had made use of a hosting service provider and that, contrary to Scanshare's claims, the hosting service provider had carried out processing activities. However, the Garante ascertained that the Region had not received any communications in relation to the involvement of a third party as sub-processor, and therefore had not provided any prior written authorisation.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that Senseonics, which is based in the US, had notified the Garante of a data breach caused by one of its employees who, as part of an information campaign, sent an emailÂ adding the recipients' addresses in the carbon copy field, which resulted in each recipient being able to view the email addresses of others.

Further to this, the Garante held that Senseonics had unlawfully communicated sensitive personal data to unauthorised third parties.
Moreover, in the course of the investigation, the Garante found further violations of the GDPR related to the use of the glucose monitoring system app managed by Senseonics. In fact, the Garante continued that, by downloading the app, users were required to accept both the contractual terms of service and the content of the privacy policy with a single 'click', thus making it impossible to formulate specific declarations of consent for different data processing operations, such as the processing of health data.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 12 May 2022, its Decision No. 176, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬7,000 on Sette Laghi Local Health Authority, for violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 9, and 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the notification of a data breach to the Garante.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that it had been notified by the Local Health Authority, pursuant to Article 33 of the GDPR, of a personal data breach concerning the delivery of a digital copy of a neuroradiological medical report to an unauthorised person.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, as a result of the investigation carried out, the Garante found that Local Health Authority had, due to an error, inserted a CD/DVD containing a patient's medical record into the envelope containing another patient's paper report. As such, the Garante held that the Local Health Authority had communicated personal data related to the health of a data subject to an unauthorisedÂ third party, in breach of the basic principles set out in Articles 5(1)(f) and 9 of the GDPR, and of the obligations relating to the security of processing, as set out in Article 32 of the GDPR.
In light of the established facts, the Garante imposed an administrative fine. In quantifying the amount of the same, the Garante, among other things, considered that the Local Health Authority had already introduced measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of the same error reoccurring.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that the Local Health Authority has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed and that, within the same timeframe, it may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 19 October 2021, its decision 317 of 16 September 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬3.3 million to Sky Italia S.r.l., for violations of Articles 5(1) and (2), 6(1), 7, 12(2), 14, 21, 28 and 29 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').
In particular, the Garante outlined that, following numerous reports and complaints, it had found that Sky had processing personal data obtained indirectly from third-party companies to carry outÂ telemarketing activities,Â noting that, while the consent given by the data subjects to these companies constituted an appropriate legal basis for the transfer of their data, the same did not apply to the subsequent processing carried out by Sky, which also failed to provide the recipients of the promotional calls with adequate information about the processing.Â Additionally, the Garante highlighted that Sky did not carry out checks on the contact lists acquired from the abovementioned companies, nor did it verify the same against its register of oppositions, resulting in several data subjects receiving promotional calls despite having previously exercised their objection to the same. Moreover, the Garante found that Sky had also signed advertising contracts with various suppliers for the performance of promotional activities on its behalf, and considered, among other things, that Sky had breached the principle of accountability, had failed to appoint the abovementioned suppliers as data processorsÂ and to check the information provided by the same to the data subjects at the time of first contact, and did notÂ adopt procedures for filtering the contact listsÂ in the availability of the suppliers.
In addition, the Garante determined that Sky had carried out promotional activities in the absence of the necessary prerequisite of lawfulness, having failed to take into account several objections received from data subjects through its certified email address, and without adopting a system that facilitates the exercise of data subjects' rights.
Furthermore, the Garante, among other things, ordered Sky to cease any processing of the kind in question, to designate its partners and suppliers as personal data processors where appropriate, and to facilitate the exercise of the right of opposition by providing among the channels for receiving the related requests including its certified emailÂ address. Finally, in determining the amount of the sanction, the Garante took into account as aggravating factorsÂ the seriousness of the violations, which were deemed rooted in Sky's corporate procedures, andÂ the significantly negligent nature of the conduct, given that its presence on the market for many years should have allowed it to acquire sufficient experience and competence to adopt basic choices in compliance with theÂ law.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 16 December 2021, its decision in Case No. 444, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬30,000 to SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire S.r.l., for violations of Articles 5(2), 6(1)(a), 12, 14, 15, 24, and 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and Article 130 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') ('the Code'),Â and issuedÂ a warning to the same for violations of Article 157 of the Code, following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante noted that the complaint concerned the receipt of a promotional communication via post, concerning hearing aid devices, following which the complainant had requested SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire to receive the precise indication of the origin of the consent to such promotional communications, without receiving any reply. Subsequently, the Garante outlined that, after multiple requests for information sent by the Garante, SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire informed the same that the processing in question was put in place by GN Hearing Srl, which had been appointed as data processor. In addition, the Garante outlined that GN Hearing, allegedly unknown to SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire, had commissioned a third company, Udibox s.r.l., to find the list of subjects to whom promotional communications should be sent. Further, the Garante clarified that Udibox sent the Garante a spontaneous declaration in which, confirming this approach, it represented that it had used an outdated list by mistake, but that it had in any case deleted the personal data of the complainant.
Further to the above, the Garante notified SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire about the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative sanction.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, the Garante outlined that it had emerged in the course of the investigation that SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire had violated:
Given the violations occurred, the Garante deemed necessary to impose an administrative sanction. In quantifying the same, the Garante considered, among other things, the likely number of data subjects involved, since the sending of commercial communications using an outdated list, although solely complained by the complainant, probably affected many data subjects, and the degree of responsibility of SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire.
Moreover, with respect to the above violations, the Garante:
In addition, the Garante found SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire in breach of Article 157 of the Code, for having repeatedly failed to respond to the Garante's requests, with a consequent aggravation of the procedure and its obstruction of carrying out investigations during the preliminary stages. However, the Garante took into account the exceptional context of the COVID-19 pandemic in which the events took place, thereby determining it sufficient to issue a fine to SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the abovementioned fine, orders, prohibition, and warning, and noted that SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. Within the same timeframe, SocietÃ Â Progetto Udire may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 29 September 2021, its decision in Case No. 353 in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10,000 to Solera Italia S.R.L.Â for violations of Article 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c), 5(1)(e), 12, 13, and 88 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), as well as Articles 113 and 114 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to the GDPR ('the Code'), following the receipt of a complaint.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant had lamented the persistent activity, after the termination of the employment relationship with Solera Italia, ofÂ their email addresses and access to the same by other employees, as well as the absence of information about the processing of the data related to said addresses even before the termination of the employment. Following a request for information issued by the Garante, Solera Italia confirmed that, while one of the email addresses of the complainant had been deactivated after the termination of the employment relationship, the other had been maintained active to allow receipt of emails from outside Solara Italia, and that emails in relation to both addresses were retained on the servers due to the importance of the duties performed by the complainant.
Findings of the Garante
Given the above, the Garante found that Solera Italia was in breach of the principles of transparency and lawfulness, pursuant to Articles 5(1)(a), 12, and 13 of the GDPR, as it had not provided employees with the necessary information regarding the processing of personal data in relation to their email addresses, including the possible controls exercised over them during and at the end of the employment relationship, and the storage of the data.
In addition, the Garante held that Solera Italia did not comply with the data minimisation and storage limitation principles. Specifically, the Garante found that Solera Italia should have deactivated both email addresses belonging to the complainant, and that it had retained emails on its servers for longer than necessary, thus being in violation of Article 5(1)(c) and (e) of the GDPR.
Moreover, the Garante observed that the systematic storage of emails could allow the reconstruction of the complainant's activities and to carry out checks on the same, and that the stored emails may include information on the complainant's personal life, considering that no policy was in place on the limits of use of corporate email addresses, resulting in a legitimate expectation of confidentiality. In light of this, the Garante concluded that the processing breached Article 88 of the GDPR, as Articles 113 and 114 of the Code constitute provisions of national law that provide more specific rules to ensure the protection of rights and freedoms in respect of employees' personal data in the employment context.
Further to the above, the Garante stated that Solera Italia must ensure that the processing of personal data carried out complies with the GDPR and the Code. In addition, the GaranteÂ banned the further processing of the data extracted from the complainant's company email addresses. In determining the amount of the fine, the Garante took into account, as aggravating factors, the lack of spontaneous compliance by Solera Italia, even after the initiation of the enforcement procedure, and that the violations in question involved general data protection principles. However, the absence of specific precedents was considered in favour of Solera Italia.
Outcomes
Finally, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine, ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction, requested that Solera Italia communicated the measures taken within 60 days, and outlined the possibility of filing an appeal before the judicial authority within 30 days.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 21 July 2022, its decision in Case No. 255, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10,000 on Stay Over srl, for violations of Articles 5, 12, 13, 15, and 88 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante outlined that the complainant alleged that Stay Over had maintained the business email account assigned to the complainant, a former employee of the same, active in order to retrieve messages accessible therein in order to ensure continuity of business operations, and to safeguard the interests of Stay Over in the legal dispute that had arisen with the complainant. Moreover, the Garante added that the complainant alleged violations by Stay Over with regard to the late and inadequate response to their data access request by Stay Over.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above and based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante found that Stay Over had not adequately informed the complainant of the data processing performed, even after the termination of the employment relationship between the complainant and the same company, on the business email account which used to be used at the same company by the complainant. Additionally, the Garante remarked that the processing of personal data carried out for the purpose of protecting one's rights in court must refer to ongoing disputes or pre-litigation situations, not to abstract and indeterminate hypotheses of possible protection of rights.
Lastly, the Garante outlined that Stay Over had responded to the complainant's access request after the deadline of one month from its receipt, without the complainant having been notified of the need to extend the request within this period. same.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Garante found that the processing in question had been unlawful, thus breaching Articles 5, 12, 13, 15, and 88 of the GDPR. In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine on Stay Over and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. Lastly, the Garante highlighted that Stay Over may lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority within 30 days.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 10 February 2022, its decision in Case No. 49, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬5,000 on Studio Colli Aniene Verdocca S.r.l., for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(2), 6(1), 7, 12(1), 12(3), 14, 15, 17, 21, and 24 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and Article 130 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to the GDPR ('the Code'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complaint, the complainant had received various phone calls promoting the services offered byÂ an estate agency, and that the complainant had not received any response to their requests to exercise their rights, which the same had submitted to Studio Colli Aniene, as the holder of the phone numbers used for the aforementioned promotional phone calls.
Following the receipt of the complaint, the Garante stated that it had initiated a preliminary investigation, which led to ascertain that the promotional calls were not carried out by the estate agency involved, but rather by Studio Colli Aniene, as the autonomous data controller, on the basis of its own independent data collection. Subsequently, the Garante noted that itÂ had notified Studio Colli Aniene of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an enforcement action.
Findings of the Garante
Further, at the end of the investigation carried out and based on the elements acquired, the Garante found that Studio Colli Aniene had systematicallyÂ collected personal data found online and had subsequently used the same to carry out promotional communications, in the absence of valid consent of the data subjects in relation to the marketing activity and in the absence of another suitable legal basis. Thus, the Garante found Studio Colli Aniene in breach of Articles 6(1) and 7 of the GDPR and 130 of the Code.
In addition, the Garante determined that Studio Colli Aniene had not provided the complainant with the information required pursuant to Article 14 of the GDPR in respect of the data indirectly collected, nor had it acknowledged the requests to exercise their rights within the time limits set out in Article 12(3) of the GDPR. Moreover, the Garante observed that, during the course of the investigation, Studio Colli Aniene did not provide any explanation as to why it had not provided any response to the complainant's request. The Garante further noted that Studio Colli Aniene had acknowledged that, despite the complainant's objections, it had made further unwanted calls to the complainant due to an alleged error. Therefore, according to the Garante, it did not appear that Studio Colli Aniene had in place a system that allowed the facilitation of the exercise of data subjects' rights. Therefore, the Garante found Studio Colli Aniene inÂ breach of Articles 12(3), 14, 15, 17, and 21 of the GDPR.
Furthermore, the Garante considered the responses provided by Studio Colli Aniene to the Garante in the course of the investigation, and deemed the same not satisfactory; for instance, the Garante reported that Studio Colli Aniene had failed to confirm the amount of data collected online for the promotional campaigns and the measures adopted to ensure the exercise of the right of opposition of data subjects. As such, the Garante found Studio Colli AnieneÂ also in breach of Articles 5(2) and 24 of the GDPR. In a similar vein, the Garante outlined that Studio Colli Aniene's failure to provide the requested information to the Garante also revealed a breach of transparency obligations, thus resulting in the infringement of Articles 5(1)(a) and 12(1) of the GDPR.
In light of the violations occurred, the Garante imposed an administrative sanction and, in quantifying the same, took into account, among others, the following aggravating and mitigating circumstances:
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction. Separately, the Garante:
Lastly, the Garante highlighted that Studio Colli AnieneÂ has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed and that, within the same timeframe, it may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 3 December 2021, in its monthly newsletter, its decision in Case No. 401, as issued on 11 November 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬150,000 on Telecom Italia S.p.A., for violations of Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and Article 132 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), following a 
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante, in its decision from May 2021, had ordered Telecom Italia to provide the complainant with access to their phone records, which had been requested in relation to a criminal trial, reserving the right to issue an administrative sanction.
Findings of the Garante
Further to this, the Garante considered, that the technical problems stated by Telecom Italia regarding the management of the complainant's requests cannot have a negative impact on his right of access and on the effective control and availability of their personal data, especially in a sensitive situation such as that of a criminal trial. In addition, the Garante stated that the alleged attempts carried out by Telecom Italia to contact the complainant by phone and the sending of a letter by post in relation to the integration of the initial requestÂ did not represent an acceptable behaviour, on account of the fact that data controllers must facilitate the exercise of the data subject's rights and provide response without undue delay and in any case not later than one month from receipt of the request. Therefore, the Garante confirmed the violations of the complainant's right of access already expressed in its previous decision from May 2021, and deemed itÂ necessary to issue an administrative sanction.
Outcomes
The Garante imposed a fine of â‚¬150,000, and outlined that Telecom Italia had the right to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed and the right to lodge an appealÂ with the judicial authority within 30 days.Â Moreover, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.
In determining the amount of the sanction, the Garante, among other things, took into consideration, as an aggravating factor, the grossly negligent conduct of Telecom Italia. In addition, the Garante considered favourably the fact Telecom ItaliaÂ had cooperated with the Garante in the course of the investigation and in the execution of the corrective measure ordered in the May 2021 decision.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant, a Telecom Italia network user, had been notified of a preliminary hearing in relation to a pending criminal proceeding involving them, further to which the complainant had requested a copy of their own telephone traffic records from Telecom Italia, in relation to incoming and outgoing calls. However, the Garante outlined that Telecom Italia had refused to provide the requested information, on the basis that, in relation to incoming telephone traffic data, the request had been submitted by the complainant more than 24 months since the relevant data had been generated. The Garante further reported that, Telecom Italia stated in relation to outgoing telephone traffic data that, it was not possible to provide the same due to a glitch. In light of this, the Garante noted the complainant had requested the Garante to order Telecom Italia to release the requested information.
Further to this, the Garante had contacted Telecom Italia inviting the same to present its comments.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, at the end of the investigation carried out and based on the evidence acquired, the Garante found that the complainant had indeed requested the incoming telephone traffic data within the 24-month timeframe established by Article 132 of the Code. In fact, the Garante outlined that the expiry of such term was due to Telecom Italia's negligence, as the same, having received the request, had let the 24-month period expire. In any case, the Garante added that the expiry of such term should not have impeded the release of the requested data, as Article 132 of the Code provides expressly that the traffic data may be released after the expiry of the 24-month term, if necessary for the investigation or prosecution of crimes.
In addition, the Garante found Telecom Italia in breach of Articles 12(2) and 12(3) of the GDPR, as it had failed to facilitate the exercise of the complainant's rights and, in particular, had failed to respond to the complainant's request without undue delay and, in any event, within one month of receipt of the request.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 7 February 2018, that it had fined Telecom Italia s.p.a. â‚¬840,000 for having made unsolicited calls to around twoÂ million former customers who had not given their prior consent to receiving telemarketing calls or had revoked it, in 2015. The violation had been ascertained by the Garante in a separate decision in 2016, which was appealed by Telecom Italia before the Court of Milan ('the Court'). After the Court rejected Telecom Italia's appeal, the Garante proceeded to issue its decision on the amount of the administrative penalty.
In determining the amount of the fine, the Garante considered the seriousness of the violation in light of the relevant database's dimension, as well as of the fact that Telecom Italia was aware of the unlawfulness of its conduct andÂ that it had been previously requested to comply with existing regulations on marketing communications. In addition,Â taking into account the enterprise's turnover,Â the Garante decided to apply the quadruplication of the basic penalty amount under Article 164-bis(4) of the Personal Data Protection Code, Legislative Decree No. 196/2003.

In particular, the Garante highlighted that TIM had made unwanted promotional phone calls without consent and despite the consumer'sÂ refusal to receive promotional calls, or without activating the specific verification procedures of the Public Register of Oppositions.
In addition, the Garante noted that certain apps provided to clients presented incorrect and not transparent information regarding data processing, as well as invalid methods for obtaining consent.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the Region had notified the Garante of a personal data breach consisting of the dissemination of the personal data of the candidates who had participated in the pre-selection phase of a public sector examination. In addition, the Garante reported that, according to the notification, one of the candidates had accidentally received an email with a URL to a portal containing the personal data of all the candidates. Additionally, the Garante outlined that the email had been sent by SCANSHARE, which was the company responsible for the organisation and management of the pre-selection and in charge of the upload of the personal data of the candidates to the aforementioned online portal. Thereafter, the Garante noted that the Region, having been alerted of the disclosure, had submitted a formal complaint to SCANSHARE for violation of the agreement in place between the parties. Further to this, the Garante noted that it had also received numerous complaints from the candidates in the relation to the aforementioned breach.
In light of the above, the Garante notified the Region of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of enforcement actions, inviting the same to present its defence briefs and to ask to be heard before the Garante.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, at the end of the investigation, the Garante observed that the agreement between the data controller and the data processor must contain a sufficient level of detail in relation to the measures that must be implemented by the latter, in order for the former to be able to comply with its obligations. However, the Garante noted that, although the agreement between the Region, as data controller, and SCANSHARE, as data processor, provided for various measures that SCANSHARE was required to put in place for the preparation of the online portal for the consultation, by each candidate, of their own personal data, the Garante ascertained that, SCANSHARE had not adopted any suitable measure to ensure that the personal data of each data subject was made available exclusively to the same or to authorised persons.
Furthermore, the Garante held that, while the absence of technical and organisational measures adequate to the risks connected to the processing in question was mainly due to SCANSHARE's failure to put in place specific access control measures, the Region had created the conditions for the occurrence of the online dissemination of the candidates' personal data, in breach of Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1)(c), and 6(1)(e) of the GDPR and Article 2-

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') published, on 3 December 2021, in its monthly newsletter, its decision in Case No. 384, as issued on 28 October 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬30,000 on Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna S.p.A., for violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(b), 5(1)(c), 5(1)(e), 5(1)(f), 6, 13, 25, 32, and 88(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and Article 114 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Containing Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('the Code'), following the receipt of a complaint submitted by an employee of Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complaint concerned the monitoring of call centre operators, carried out by Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna, through a telephone management system. In addition, the Garante outlined that, in the course of the investigation, Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna had justified the use of such system based on the need to verify the quality of customer service and to manage customers' complaints. Based on the information acquired, the Garante notified Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of the measures pursuant to Article 58(2) of the GDPR, inviting the same to produce defence briefs or to ask to be heard before the Garante.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante found that, contrary to what was claimed by Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna, the employees had not been adequately informed about the use of the telephone management systems, which not only managed telephone calls, but also allowed the recording and replaying of telephone calls, and the storage (for an unspecified period of time) of other information relating to the work activity of the single call centre operator, such as the name of the operator, the duration of calls, the numbers contacted, and the date and time of such calls. As such, the Garante considered that the telephone management system was not simply a work tool, but rather a form of remote control of employees. Therefore, the Garante stated that Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna should have carried out the data processing in accordance with the national regulations that govern the use of technological tools in the workplace, which constitute specific conditions of lawfulness of the processing.
In addition, the Garante found that through the use of the telephone management system in question, Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna had processed the personal data of call centre operators in a way that did not comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, storage limitation, and Data Protection By Design and By Default, as well as in the absence of adequate security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the personal data.
Further to the above, the Garante stated that the violation of the aforementioned provisions is subject to the application of an administrative sanction. In determining the amount of the same, the Garante took into account, among other things, that the violations likely concerned a significantÂ number of employees, however it also considered favourably the collaboration provided by Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna during the investigation. Moreover, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction.

The Garante imposed the fine ofÂ â‚¬30,000 and outlined that Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna has the right

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 20 July 2021, that it had issued a decision to fine the Trento local health authority â‚¬150,000 for unlawful disclosure of the health information of 293 patients, including twoÂ minors, who had made data masking requests pursuant to Decree No. 178 of 29 September 2015 on Electronic Health Records. In particular, the Garante outlined that, although a number of patients had requested the masking of medical reports related to the termination of their pregnancies, the health authority had transmitted said reports to general practitioners due to a technical error.
The Garante found that the disclosure of the patients' health data constituted a violation of the principles of lawfulness and integrity and confidentiality under Articles 5(2)(a) and (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('GDPR'), and that the health authority had disclosed said sensitive data without a suitable legal basis in violation ArticleÂ 9 of theÂ GDPR.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 26 June 2020, that it had published, in its monthly newsletter, a decision ('the Decision') fining UniCredit S.p.A. â‚¬600,000 for violating Articles 162(2-bis), 162(2-ter), and 164-bis(2) of the Personal Data Protection Code, Legislative Decree No. 196/2003 ('the Privacy Code'), in its pre-General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') version.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 16 June 2022, its Decision No. 225, as issued on 16 June 2022, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬70,000 on UniCredit S.p.A., a bank, for violations of Articles 12 and 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the receipt of a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that, according to the complaint, UniCredit did not satisfy the data subject access request of the complainant, who asked the GaranteÂ to order UniCredit to comply with the access request, as well as to warn UniCredit that the form prepared for the exercise of data subject rights violated or may violate the relevant provisions of the GDPR. Moreover, the Garante detailed that UniCredit stated that no response had been given to the access request because they had not taken any action on UniCredit's communication of 3 April 2019, in which the bank asked the complainant to forward the request to them by filling in the form on the bank's Privacy Portlet.
Findings of the Garante
As a result of the investigation,Â the Garante found the justifications brought by UniCredit to be insufficient, explaining that the preparation of a form may constitute an organisational modality aimed at facilitating the interested parties, but it is notÂ in accordance with the applicable rules on the protection of personal data to condition the start of the procedure for the exercise of the right of access on the basis of completing said form, and not to take into consideration the merits of the requests presented in free form.
Moreover, the Garante noted that the application submitted indicatedÂ in detail the range of personal data in relation to which the right was being exercised pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR. Lastly, the Garante explained that the exercise of the right of access to one's own personal data is strictly related to the identification of the specific modalities and time limits by which the data controller is required to meet the data subject's requests, identified by Article 12 of the GDPR in order to make the principles of transparency and fairness effective.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine and ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction and also ordered UniCredit to communicate which steps have been taken to implement the provisions of this measure within 90 days from the proceeding. In addition,Â the Garante highlighted that UniCredit may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority within 30 days from the notification date of this proceeding.

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 16 December 2021, its decision in Case No. 448, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬1,000 to UniversitÃ  Telematica Internazionale UNINETTUNO, a public university, for violations of ArticleÂ 5(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant, a university professor, had sent their CV to UNINETTUNO for the purposes of a selection procedure and that afterwards, despite the fact that the contract was never finalised, the CV (which included personal data, such as address, telephone number, email address, marital status, and signature) had been published onÂ UNINETTUNO's website, and indexed on search engines. In addition, the Garante noted that the complainant had sent a request to UNINETTUNO to delete their personal data, following which the data protection officer ('DPO') had confirmed the requested removal and that actions were being taken to de-index the CV from search engines.
Further to this, the Garante had requested UNINETTUNO to provide its comments on the facts in question. Based on the submissions, the Garante notified UNINETTUNO about the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of an administrative sanction.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, the Garante outlined that, in the course of the investigation, it became apparentÂ that UNINETTUNO had published the complainant's CV on its institutional website, failing to obscure the data relating to the complainant's personal sphere, which cannot be considered adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which the information is processed, thus violatingÂ the principle of data minimisation. In addition, the Garante highlighted that the processing of such personal data, in a manner that does not comply with said principle, had also entailed a further and wider dissemination of the data, due to the indexing on search engines of the web page hosting the complainant's CV.
In consideration of the violation occurred, the Garante imposed an administrative fine and therebyÂ took into consideration, among other things, the fact that the violation lasted for a significant period of time, while it considered favourably that the violation did not involve sensitive data and affected only one data subject.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned fine onÂ UNINETTUNO and indicated that the same has 30 days to settle the dispute by paying an amount equal to half of the sanction imposed. Within the same timeframe, UNINETTUNO may also lodge an appeal before the ordinary judicial authority.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante noted that the complaint concerned the receipt of an envelope, which contained the wording 'anomalous credit Chieti'. Following this, the Garante invited Unione di Banche Italiane to present its observations. More specifically, the GaranteÂ stated that Unione di Banche ItalianeÂ noted that the envelope did not contain payment reminders, which were always sent by the relevant branch where the complainant's affairs are based, but a communication on the transparency of banking and financial services. Subsequently, the Garante notified Unione di Banche Italiane about the initiation of the sanctioning procedure.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, the Garante outlined that it had emerged in the course of the investigation that Unione di Banche Italiane had used, in the header of the envelope addressed to the complainant, the term 'anomalous credit', and held that this term, regardless of the content of the envelope, is likely to disclose to third parties information relating to the financial situation of the recipient of the communication. As such, the Garante found Unione di Banche Italiane in breach of the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and data minimisation under the GDPR.
Furthermore, the Garante outlined that the violations occurred subjected Unione di Banche Italiane to a pecuniary sanction. In determining the amount of the same, the Garante took into consideration, among other things:

Background to the decision 
In particular, the Garante reported that the complainant had submitted numerous interrelated complaints over time, lamenting the unlawful processing of personal data carried out by the Municipality in the context of termination of the employment relationship with the complainant. More specifically, the Garante outlined that, according to the complainant:
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, while the Garante dismissed the part of the complaint concerning the failure to respond to the aforementioned requests of the complainant, it found that the Municipality, by publishing on its institutional website the resolutions containing the complainant's personal data, had violated the principle of data minimisation. Additionally, on account of the fact that such publication remained available online for longer than permitted by law, the Municipality had also breached the provisions of Articles 2-ter(1) and 2-ter(3) of the Code (the version effectiveÂ at the time of the conduct), and had processed the complainant's personal data without a suitable legal basis, thus violating also the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. Moreover, the Garante held that the Municipality had not provided the parties present at the Municipality meeting with the necessary information concerning the recording carried out, in violations of its transparency and information obligations.
Furthermore, in determining the amount of the fine, the Garante took into account, among other things, the fact that the conduct in question was of a culpable nature. However, the Garante considered that the Municipality is a small entity and that the same had collaborated with the Garante during the investigation. Notably, the Garante highlighted that the strained relations between the parties involved, as well as the high number of communications exchanged between the same had made it difficult to reconstruct the disputed events.
Outcome
Lastly, the Garante ordered the publication of the decision on its website as an ancillary sanction and imposed the aforementioned fine, establishing that the payment should be received within 30 days from the notification of the decision, and noted that the Municipality may lodge an appeal before the judicial authority.

In particular, Garante highlighted that Vincall had authorised anÂ Albanian call-centre Tele It to carry out telemarketing activities for the purpose of concluding new energy contracts for Edison Energy S.p.A. and Green Power s.r.l. Garante noted that following an inspection from the Special Privacy Department of the Fiscal Police, it was found that Tele It had reached out to prospects without checking its marketing list against those of Edison, Green Power and Vincall, and that Vincall had failed to provide recipients with adequate information pursuant to Articles 13 and 161 of the Personal Data Protection Code, Legislative Decree No. 196/2003 ('the Code'), following telephone contacts. Furthermore, Garante stated that Vincall had not acquired the consent of the data subjects for the collection of their personal data for marketing purposes.Â 
As a result, the Garante determined the sanction of â‚¬6,000 for each of the 78 violations to Articles 13 and 161 of the Code and â‚¬10,000 for each of the 155 violations of Articles 23 and 162(2-bis) of the Code.

In particular, Garante outlined that the investigation on the telemarketing practices of VodafoneÂ and its sales' network started because of hundreds of individual complaints concerning unsolicited marketing calls. In addition, Garante highlighted that the investigation found serious violations in relation to the collection of consent, as well as to theÂ principles of accountability and Privacy by Design. More specifically, Garante stated thatÂ Vodafone, among other things, used fictitious phone numbers that were not in any case included in the Register of Communication OperatorsÂ in order to carry out the telemarketing activities, and that the same were to be linked to call centres continuously violating data protection legislation.
Moreover, Garante noted that Vodafone received marketing lists from commercial partners without the free, informed, and specific consent of data subjects. Furthermore, Garante found that Vodafone had adopted inadequate security measures in relation to the clients management systems, since Vodafone's employees requested individuals to send identity documents via Whatsapp, with the potential purpose of carrying out spamming, phishing, or other unlawful activities. As a result, Garante provided that Vodafone's conduct amounted to a violation of Articles 5(1) and (2), 6(1), 7, 15(1), 16, 21, 24, 25(1), 32, and 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679).

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') announced, on 13 July 2020, that it had issued a decision ('the Decision') fining Wind Tre S.p.A. â‚¬16.7 million for several unlawful data processing activities in relation to direct marketing practices. In particular, Garante outlined that hundreds of complainants claimed that they received unsolicited communications, sent without their previous consent, through SMS, email, phone calls, and automated calls. In addition, Garante highlighted that the individual claimants argued that they have not been able to exercise their right to withdraw consent and to oppose the processing for direct marketing purposes, since the information contained in the privacy policy was incomplete in relation to the means of contact used. Moreover, Garante stated that the claimants' data was published on telephone public lists despite their opposition. Furthermore, Garante found that Wind Tre's apps 'MyWind' and 'My3' were set in order to oblige the user to provide his/her consent for different processing activities withÂ every access, leaving the possibility to withdraw the same only after 24 hours. In addition, Garante pointed that Wind Tre presented various deficiencies in the management of third-party partners, even in relation to the unlawful activation of contracts.
As a result, Garante found that Wind Tre's conduct amounted to a violation of ArticlesÂ 5(1) and (2), 6(1)(a), 12, 24, and 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').

Background to the decision
In particular, the Garante reported that the financial police had carried out an inspection at the premises of Zito Auto, in which it had ascertained the presence of 14 functioning CCTV cameras placed both inside and outside the company's premises, which allowed the remote monitoring of employees' activities.
Findings of the Garante
Further to the above, as a result of the investigation carried out, the Garante considered that the fact that Zito Auto's employees had been individually informed of the presence of the CCTV cameras did not suffice, noting that, in the employment context, consent does not constitute an appropriate legal basis for the processing of employees' personal data. Further, the Garante determined that the employeeÂ monitoring practices were not in line with the guarantees required by Law No. 300 of 1970, establishing the Workers' Statute.Â In light of the established facts, the Garante took the view that the processing of personal data carried out by Zito Auto through the CCTV cameras violated Articles 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(c) of the GDPR and Article 114 of the Code.

In this regard, the Garante noted that such failings hadÂ allowed anyone using theÂ payment service to access the personal data of citizens who had been fined and who could make use of the payment service. Furthermore, the Garante noted that the municipality had been using an external processor, Ica s.r.l, which provided the software and processed the data in connection with the payment service on its behalf, when a functionality failure had allowed access to citizens' personal data through the service.Â

Moreover,Â taking into accountÂ that La Prima had affirmed its convictionÂ regardingÂ the lawfulness of its conduct, theÂ GaranteÂ posited that it was possible to deduce that such practices, while not being adequate to guarantee compliance with the GDPR, fell within La Prima's usual data processing methods, leading to a violation of Article 24 andÂ 25 of the GDPR. Furthermore, theÂ GaranteÂ observed that La Prima had repeatedlyÂ failed toÂ provideÂ information on the processing in question upon the Garante's request, thusÂ violating Article 157 of the Personal Data Protection Code,Â ContainingÂ Provisions to Adapt the National Legislation to GDPR, issuing an administrative fine as a result. However, with regards toÂ theÂ other violations, theÂ GaranteÂ only issued a reprimand, stressing that the decisionÂ was a sufficient and proportionate measureÂ in consideration ofÂ theÂ circumstances of the case and in particular the current situation of hardship for the real estate sector caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Â

'''The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 24 February 2022, its decision in Case No. 63, in which it issued a warning to the Emilia-Romagna Region, for violations ofÂ Articles 5(1)(a), 6, 9, and 35 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following an investigation initiated by the Garante, in conjunction with other decisions issued against the Regions of 
Background to the case
In particular, the Garante explained that Decree Law No. 34 of 19 May 2020, as converted into law by Law No. 77 of 17 July 2020, provides, under Article 7(1), that the Ministry of HealthÂ may process personal data, including health data, collected in the systems of the National Health Service, for the development of predictive methodologies of the evolution of the health needs of the population. In addition, the Garante outlined that, for the purpose of developing such methodologies and obtaining the required opinion of the Garante on the same, the Ministry had created an interinstitutional group, which was tasked with developing the prototype version of the predictive model, and in which sevenÂ Italian Regions and one Autonomous ProvinceÂ had been invited to participate, and in which the Garante took part as auditor.
Further to this, the Garante noted that it had requested the Ministry for information on the personal data that the aforementioned Regions and Autonomous ProvinceÂ had provided to the Ministry for the purpose of developing the prototype model. Subsequently, the Garante stated that the Ministry had confirmed that it had exclusively received statistical data already aggregated by the eight Italian Regions/Autonomous Province, which had therefore acted as autonomous data controllers. In light of this, the Garante, having received comments from the Regions amd Autonomous Province involved,Â notified the same of the initiation of the procedure for the adoption on enforcement actions.
Findings of the Garante
Moreover, based on the elements acquired in the course of the investigation, the Garante determined that the Emilia-Romagna Region, contrary to what the same had argued, had in fact acted as data controller. With this regard, the Garante outlined that the circumstance where a third party (in this case, the Ministry), asks a data controller (in this case, the Emilia-Romagna Region) to carry out processing operations on personal data for which the same is the data controller, does not entail the automatic attribution of the status of data controller to the former, nor the loss of said status by the latter.
Additionally, the Garante found that the Emilia-Romagna Region had carried out the processing in question in the absence of a suitable legal basis, without meeting any of the exceptions to the general prohibition to the processing of sensitive data, and in breach of the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, given that the processing was carried out outside the purposes legitimately pursued by the Emilia-Romagna Region and that the governing rules, in force at the time of the events in question, attributed to the Ministry alone the task of processing personal data collected in the information systems of the National Health Service, for the development of predictive methodologies. Moreover, the Garante considered that the Emilia-Romagna Region had violated its obligation to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA'), having wrongly assumed that the same was a duty of the Ministry.
Given the violations occurred, the Garante deemed sufficient to impose a warning, taking into account, among others, that:

In conclusion, the Garante imposed the aforementioned warning and highlighted that the Emilia-Romagna Region may lodge an appeal before the judicial authority within 30 days.

'''The Lower Saxony data protection authority ('LfD Niedersachsen') announced, onÂ 28 July 2022, that it had issued a decision in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬900,000Â on a credit institution, for violations of Article 6(1)(f) of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following an investigation by theÂ LfD Niedersachsen.
Background to the case
In particular, theÂ LfD Niedersachsen stated that the decision concerns the credit institution'sÂ processing ofÂ data from active and former customers without their prior consent. More specifically, theÂ LfD Niedersachsen noted thatÂ through the use of a service provider, theÂ companyÂ analysedÂ digital-useÂ behaviour and evaluated, among other things, the total volume of app store purchases, the frequency of use of account statement printers, and the total amount of online banking transfers in comparison to the use of branches.Â Additionally, theÂ LfD Niedersachsen highlighted that the company had compared the results ofÂ itsÂ analyses with information from aÂ credit agency and thereby enriched their analysesÂ from there, withÂ theÂ ultimateÂ aim ofÂ identifying and targeting customers with an increased inclination for digital media forÂ advertising purposes.Â 
Findings of the LfD NiedersachsenÂ 
Notably, theÂ LfD Niedersachsen found that the company's reliance on legitimate interests as a legal basis for its processing of personal data, pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR,Â was inadequate in the circumstances of the case. More specifically, theÂ LfD Niedersachsen stated that when balancing interests in connection with use of legitimate interest legal basis, controllers must,Â among other things, take into account the reasonable expectations ofÂ data subjects, who in this context would notÂ expect the use of databases on a large scale to identify their inclination towards certain product categories or communication channels. As such, theÂ LfD Niedersachsen noted thatÂ the companyÂ couldÂ therefore not invoke legitimate interest as a legal basis and must instead obtain consent from data subjects.Â 
Outcomes
Ultimately, theÂ LfD Niedersachsen stated that it had accused the company of being in contravention ofÂ Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR and thus lacking a sufficient legal basis to process customers' personal data and in this regard imposed a fine of â‚¬900,000 on the company. Notably, however theÂ LfD Niedersachsen expressed that the fine is not yet final.Â

'''The Lower Saxony data protection authority ('LfD Niedersachsen') announced, on 26 July 2022, that it had issued a decision in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬1.1 million to Volkswagen AG, for violation of Articles 13, 28, 35, and 30 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a traffic control by the Austrian police.
Background to the decision
In particular, the LfD Niedersachsen reported that a VolkswagenÂ test vehicle had been stopped by the Austrian police in 2019, following which the police officers had noticed unusual attachments on the vehicle, which turned out to be cameras. More specifically, the LfD Niedersachsen explained that the vehicle was used to test and train the functionality of a driving assistance system to avoid traffic accidents and that the traffic around the test vehicle was recorded for error analysis.
Findings of the LfD Niedersachsen
Further to the above, the LfD Niedersachsen found that:
However, the LfD Niedersachsen highlighted that no violations had been found with regards to the collection and further processing of personal data that occurred in the process.
In light of the above, the LfD Niedersachsen imposed a fine on Volkswagen, taking into account the fact that the violations were of low severity and that Volkswagen had promptly remedied its deficiencies. Notably, the LfD Niedersachsen explained that, due to the cross-border nature of the data processing in question, before issuing the penalty notice, it had involved other European data protection authorities in the context of the cooperation procedure established under Article 60 of the GDPR.

'''The Luxembourg data protection authority ('CNPD') published, on 26 November 2021, its decision in Case No. 40FR/2021, as issued on 27 October 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬15,400 onÂ an unnamedÂ company for violating Articles 38(1), 38(3), and 39(1)(a) and (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and a corrective measures regarding the appointment of the data protection officer ('DPO'), following the investigation.
Background to the case
In particular, the CNPD highlighted that it had decided to launch an investigation regarding the function of a DPO, opening 25 audit procedures in 2018 which largely concerned the private sector. As part of this audit, the head investigator defined 11 control objectives, which were included in their visit report regarding the company, dated 20 February 2019, and include the following:
Findings of the CNPD
Firstly, the CNPD outlined that although documents were provided concerning the presentation of the activity of the DPOÂ to the management committee of the company, the document only provided proof that theÂ presentation was made, and failed to evidence that the DPO was appropriately involved in all matters relating to the protection of personal data, thus violating Article 38(1) of the GDPR. Â 
Furthermore, the CNPD found that although the DPO reportedÂ to management of the company, there were two hierarchical layers between the DPO and the management, and therefore, direct access of the DPO to management committee's was not guaranteed, thereby breaching Article 38(3) of the GDPR.
In addition, the CNPD found that the company engaged in no formal reporting on the activities of the DPO on a regular basis, and that there was no proof that statements mentioning the formal reporting of the DPO's activities on a quarterly basis actually occurred, thereby violating Article 39(1)(a) of the GDPR.
Moreover, the CNPD detailed that the company did not have a formalised control plan specific to data protection, even though such a requirement does not need to have been executed. Therefore, the CNPD found that the DPO could not exercise their objective of controlling the compliance of the data controller, as stated within Article 39(1)(b) of the GDPR.
Outcomes 
Specifically, the CNPD imposed a fine of â‚¬15,400 on the company for its breach of the obligations of a DPO under Articles 38(1), 38(3), and 39(1)(a) and (b) of the GDPR. In addition, the CNPD outlined four corrective measures to be taken, including:

Background to the case
In particular, the CNPD highlighted that guidelines regarding the responsibilities of DPOs have been available since December 2016, and that an audit report initiated in September 2018 found failures to, among other things, publish the contact details of the DPO, to involve the DPO in all questions relating to the protection of personal data, and to guarantee the autonomy of the DPO.
Findings of the CNPD
More specifically, the CNPD found that the failure to publish the contact details of the DPO was in violation of Article 37(7) as individuals external to the company were unable to contact the DPO without having to contact another agency service. Further, the CNPD noted that the company violated Article 38(1) of the GDPR holding that the DPO was not involved in every matter related to data protection despite their participation in relevant committees. Similarly, the CNPD outlined that the company violated Article 38(3) of the GDPR, which states that the data controller and processor should ensure that theÂ DPO does not receive instructions with regard to their tasks.Â Furthermore, the CNPD found that the company was in violation of Article 39(1)(b) of the GDPR because it emerged there was no formalised data control plan, despite it being under construction at the time of the initial audit.
Outcomes 
The CNPD imposed the aforementionedÂ fine taking into account the following influential factors:
In addition, the corrective action regarding Article 38(3) to enable the DPO to report directly to the highest level of the company, was decided uponÂ taking into account the procedures carried out to comply with the provisions of the violated articles of the GDPR.

Background to the decision
In particular, the CNPD highlighted that it had decided to launch an investigative campaign regarding the function of a DPO, opening 25 audit procedures in 2018 which largely concerned the private sector. As part of this audit, the head investigator defined 11 control objectives, which were included in their visit report regarding the company, dated 27 February 2019, and are as follows:
Findings of CNPD
Firstly, the CNPD concluded that the company offers a loyalty card service to its customers and had a substantial number of active cards used in a year. In this regard, the CNPD highlighted that, in their findings, it took note of the fact that the company in question documented its analysis internally, in collaboration with its consultants, in order to determine whether or not it needed to appoint a DPO. According to the CNPD, on the basis of this analysis, the company had concluded that it did not seem necessary in view of the activities carried out.
However, the CNPD found that the company performs systematicÂ and regular monitoring of customers' purchases, in addition to processing data which included purchase history and loyalty points. In light of this, the CNPD confirmed that this constituted an activity that should have been accounted for and reviewed against the relevant DPO appointment guidelines available. Furthermore, the CNPD found that the loyalty card service falls under the meaning of 'large scale' monitoring in accordance with Article 37(1) of the GDPR.
Finally, in light of these findings, the CNPD concluded that the company in question had failed to appoint a DPO, and was therefore in breach of Article 37(1) of the GDPR.
Outcomes
The CNPD imposed a fine of â‚¬80,000 on the company for its breach of the obligation to appoint a DPO under Article 37(1) of the GDPR. In addition, the corrective action, which was decided upon taking into account the above discussed factors, stated that the company has six months to comply and appoint a DPO, failing which it will be fined â‚¬1,000 for every day the company has not complied with the corrective action beyond the six-month deadline.

In particular, the deliberation cites a failure to document a breach of personal data, notify the CNPDÂ as the relevant authority, as well as notify the data subjects, implement appropriate security measures, and, lastly, communicate the contact details of the data protection officer ('DPO') to the CNPD. More specifically, the CNPD noted that it had received a complaint following a data breach, whereby the insurance company had sent multiple emails to an incorrect email address, which included personal information such as surname, questions regarding a specific illness, the surname of the doctor providing the health insurance, and the address of the same doctor.
In addition to the above violations the CNPD determined that the company's actions had also resulted in violations of Articles 33(1), 33(5), 34(1), and 37(7) of the GDPR. Further to this, the CNPD requestedÂ that the company implement appropriate security measures to protection special category data sent via email, for example with measures such as encryption, robust passwords, or any such alternative method which might ensure a similar level of protection considering the state of the art and relevant best practices.

'''The Luxembourg data protection authority ('CNPD') published, on 26 November 2021, its decision in Case No. 34FR/2021, as issued on 29 September 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬1,000 on an unnamed public bodyÂ for violations of Article 15(2) of theÂ Act of 1 August 2018 on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data in Criminal and National Security Matters ('the Act'), following a complaint.Â 
Background to the decision
In particular, the CNPD outlined that, on 26 SeptemberÂ 2018, the claimant exercised their right of access to their personal data processed by the public body on the basis of Article 13 of the Act, and subsequently the complainant exercised their right to erasure relating to their personal data based on Article 15 of the Act, which deals with personal data in criminal matters and national security. In this context, via a letter datedÂ 10 December 2018, the public body confirmed the deletion of certain personal data, but refused to delete otherÂ data, claiming that their retention period had not expired.
Findings of the CNPD
In particular, the CNPD noted that the allegedly deleted files were found in a 'trash'Â folder, which allowed storage in order to recover a folder deleted by mistake. According to the CNPD, the contents of theÂ  'trash'Â folder was never erased, so therefore, many documents were still stored, thus violating Article 15(2) of the Act by not allowing the data subject to retain control over their sensitive data. InÂ fact, in order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine for theÂ breach of Article 15(2) of the Act, the CNPD considered the nature of the violation, which was deemed asÂ particularly seriousÂ as it relates to the processing of personal data in criminal matters and national security.
Outcomes
Moreover, the CNPD imposed a fine ofÂ â‚¬1,000 and ordered the public body to permanently delete the complainant's data of the same natureÂ within one month following receipt of the notification of this decision.Â Lastly, the CNPD condemned the public body to pay â‚¬100 per day of delay from the end of the one month period following receipt of notification.

In addition, the CNPD found that the both DPOs who were employed by the public body over the course of the investigation had failed to comply with the requirements under ArticleÂ 39(1)(b) of the GDPR to monitor the organisation's day-to-day GDPR compliance activities, highlighting that the public body had fully outsourced this function to an external service provider. Moreover, the CNPD highlighted that although the contact details of the DPO were available on the organisation's website, such details were difficult to find. The CNPD identified this as a breach of the obligation to publish the contact details of the DPO under Article 37(7) of the GDPR, highlighting that publishing of the contact details of the DPO on a website without taking the necessary measures to ensure that data subjectsÂ are able to find the information and understand it amounts to rendering the obligation under Article 37(7) of the GDPR meaningless.
In addition to the financial penalty, the CNPD ordered the public body to remedy the violations that have not been addressed within six months, namely to provide sufficient resources to the DPO and to ensure that the DPO is involved in GDPR compliance monitoring activities.Â

Background to the case

Furthermore, the CNPD outlined that CNPD agents visited the unnamed company's premises to carry out the investigationÂ on 29 January 2020.Â 
Findings of the CNPD 
In particular, the CNPD outlined that with regard to the information provided to third parties and employees about the video surveillance system, the head of the investigation noted that the controller used small stickers affixed next to the entrance door at the front of the cafÃ© to inform about the presence of video surveillance measures. In addition, the CNPD concurred with the head of the investigation that neither the sticker nor the signs affixed after the on-site visit of the CNPD agents fulfilled all the requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR. Hence, the CNPD agreed with the head of the investigation that the controller had failed in its obligation to inform both employees and third parties about the video surveillance as required by Article 13 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the CNPD agreed with the head of the investigation that at the time of the on-site visit of the CNPD agents the controller had failed to comply with its obligation under Article 5.1(c) of the GDPR, with regard to third parties and employees.

Background to the case
In particular, the CNPD stated that it had decided, on 22 November 2018, to launch an investigation into the unnamed company on the basis of Article 37 of the Act of 1 August 2018 on the Organisation of the National Commission for Data Protection and Implementing the GDPR ('the Act') and the general data protection regime. In addition, the CNPD noted that the purpose of the investigation was to monitor the application of and compliance with the GDPR and the Act, by verifying the compliance of measures implemented by the unnamed company, in particular by means of a geolocation and a video surveillance device. Furthermore, the CNPD outlined that CNPD agents visited the unnamed company's premises to carry out the investigation on 7 December 2018.
Findings of the CNPD
In particular, the CNPD outlined that the agents observed during the on-site visit that the presence of the video surveillance system was not reported to third parties, such as customers, suppliers, and visitors nor to the employees. Thus, the CNPD concurred with the head of the investigation and concluded that at the time of the on-site visit by the agents, the company failed in its obligation to inform third parties and employees under Article 13 of the GDPR. In addition, the CNPD noted that the surveillance of neighbouring land was disproportionate in view of the purposes for which video surveillance was operated, hence the company breached Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR.
Furthermore, the CNPD noted that the head of investigation found during the on-site visit that the presence of the geolocation device is not indicated inside the rented vehicles and that third parties are informed about the geolocation device by signing the rental contract which includes specific stipulation relating to this. However, the CNPD concurred with the head investigation that the specific stipulation contained in the vehicle rental contract to inform third parties of the presence of the geolocation device did not meet the requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR. Moreover, the CNPD concluded that the company failed in its obligation arising from Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR since the CNPD considered that no documentation submitted by the company contains proof that the retention period of geolocation data was no longer than necessary in order to achieve the goals pursued by the controller.
Outcomes
As a result, the CNPD imposed a fine of â‚¬4,900 on the unnamed company and also required the unnamed company to bring the processing operations into compliance with the obligations resulting from Articles 5(1)(c), 5(1)(e), and 13 of the GDPR, within a period of four months following notification of the decision.

Background to the case
In particular, the GPDP outlined that it had received complaints from data subjects regarding employees of the real estate agencies who had been calling data subjects without reason.
Findings of the GPDP
More specifically, the GPDP outlined that it had identified two breaches byÂ the real estate agencies.
Firstly, the GPDP identified that the real estate agencies did not obtain the unequivocal consent of data subjects before carrying out the telemarketing activities, and further that the processing of personal data was not pursuant to the performance of a contract agreed between the data subjects and the real estate agency. Accordingly, the real estate agencies were found to have violated Article 6 of the PDPAÂ in that the processing personal data was not legitimate.
In addition, the GPDP outlined that the real estate agencies had not clearly communicated both the personal data that needed to be processed and how the data had been obtained, thereby violating Article 11 of the PDPAÂ on data subjects right of access. Furthermore, the GPDP noted that one of the real estate agencies had not respected the data subjects' right to object, after failing to take action following data subjects' objections to receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls.
Outcomes
In view of the above, the GPDP imposed fines of MOP 14,000 (approx. â‚¬1,580) and MOP 30,000 (approx. â‚¬3,300), and highlighted a sanction on one real estate agency to remove from computer systems all personal data of affected data subjects.

'''The Dutch data protection authority ('AP') announced, on 24 February 2022, its decision issued on, 14 January 2022, to impose a fine of â‚¬525,000 on DPG Media Magazines B.V. (formerly known as Sanoma Media Netherlands B.V.) for violation of Article 12(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), followingÂ complaints submitted by its customers and subscribers for unnecessarily requesting ID.
Background to the case
In particular, the AP provided that, in the period of May 2018 to January 2019, they received five complaints about DPG Media's conduct with regards to requests for access to and request for erasure of personal data of data subjects. Moreover, the AP noted that according to the complainants, DPG Media asked for a copy of an identity document from the complainants to verify their identity, as a condition for further processing their request for access or deletion.
Findings of the AP
Subsequently, the AP investigated DPG Media's policy regarding retrieval and processing of a copy of proof of identity with submitted requests for access to or erasure of personal data. Furthermore, the AP highlighted that the scope of the investigation was requests made by complainants outside the secure login environment of an account with DPG Media, which included submissions made via letter, email or web form for access to or erasure of personal data.
In its finding, the AP detailed, amongÂ other things, that DPG Media as a data controller processed personal data, including the name, address, place of residence and/or email address of its customers or subscribers for one of DPG Media's Dutch brands, or of persons who had an account on Schoolbank.nl.
In addition, the AP confirmed that,Â when receiving a request for access to or erasure of personal data made outside the secure login environment of an account with DPG Media, DPG Media always requested a copy of proof of the data subject's identity, including sensitive data, regardless of what contact information was available at DPG Media, about the data subject, and without taking into account the natureÂ and amount of personal data that was requested to be viewed or deleted. Further to this, the AP emphasised, disagreeing with DPG Media's view, that the exercise of rights of data subjects must be set up in such a way that a data subject must be able to identify themselves in the least intrusive manner pursuant to Article 12 of the GDPR. As a result, the AP pointed out that the condition applied by DPG Media to submit a copy of an identity document with a request from a data subject was disproportionate to the nature and amount of personal data about which a request was made.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the AP deemed it appropriate in view of the seriousness of the violation to impose a fine of â‚¬525,000 on DPG Media for acting in violation of Article 12(2) of the GDPR. Moreover, the AP notes that DPG Media has objected to the decision.

In particular, the AP highlighted that the hospital had not implemented adequate internal security measures to protect patient records, which was revealed after medical staff had unnecessarily accessed records of a well-known Dutch citizen, leading to an investigation.
In addition, the AP noted that in case if the hospital does not improve its security measures by 2 October 2019, it will also be subject to a penalty of â‚¬100,000 every two weeks, with a maximum of â‚¬300,000. The AP outlined that the hospital had failed to implement controls concerning who has the ability to access patient records and put in place a system requiring at least two-factor authentication.

In particular, the AP noted that the UWV insufficiently guaranteed and safeguarded a risk-adjusted security level in the context of sending group messages via 'My Workmap-enviroment' to a group of job seekers. As a result, the AP highlighted that files containing a multitude of personal data of job seekers ended up with the wrong recipients, namely in the My Work Folder environment of other job seekers. Moreover, the AP confirmed that 9 data breaches occurred for this reason and that the number of job seekers whose data between 2016 and 2018 ranged between 10 to 11,062 people per data breach.

In particular, the AP held in its Decision that the KNLTB sold personal data such as name, gender, and addressÂ without having obtained the consent of the data subjects. Furthermore, the AP held that theÂ KNLTP's argument that itÂ had a legitimate interest in selling the data was unsubstantiated and ruled that they hadÂ no legal basis for passing on the personal data to the sponsors, therefore violating Article 6 of theÂ Act Implementing theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').

'''The Dutch data protection authority ('AP') announced, on 7 December 2021, its decision to impose a fine of â‚¬2.75 million on the Minister of Finance, for violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679),Â citing discriminatory and illegal processing of dual nationality status by tax authorities.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AP noted that the tax authorities had kept and used the dual nationality of Dutch nationals in assessing applications for childcare allowance. Moreover, the AP highlighted that although this was not the intended use of the data, the tax authorities processed the dual nationality of applicants to combat organised fraud. In addition, the AP confirmed that the Tax and Customs Administration used the nationality of applicants as an indicator in a system that automatically designated certain applicants as high risk, although the purpose of use of the data was not for this.
Findings of the AP
In its findings, the AP noted that tax authorities had committed serious violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) by processing the dual nationality of applicants for childcare allowance in an unlawful, discriminatory, and improper manner. Moreover, the AP highlighted that the tax authorities should have deleted the dual nationality of Dutch citizens in January 2014, as the dual nationality of Dutch nationals did not play a role in assessing applications for childcare allowance.
In addition, the AP determined that the processing of dual nationality of Dutch citizens for assessing applications, combating fraud, and the risk system was unlawful and therefore is prohibited.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the AP deemed appropriate to impose a fine of â‚¬2.75 million on the Minister of Finance, as they are responsible for the processing of personal data within the tax authorities. Furthermore, the AP informed that, following the investigations by the AP, the Tax and Customs AdministrationÂ started to addressing its internal systems. Moreover, the AP emphasised that the tax authorities can still appeal against the fine imposed by the AP.

'''The Dutch data protection authority ('AP') announced, on 12 April 2022, its decision, as issued onÂ 7 April 2022, to impose a fine of â‚¬3.7 million on the Ministry of Finance ('the Ministry') for violation of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(b), 5(1)(d), 5(1)(e), 6(1), 32(1) and 35(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following an investigation on processing personal data in the fraud signalling facility ('FSV') application conducted by the AP.
Background to the case
In particular, the AP provided that in the period from 4 November 2013 to 27 February 2020, the Tax and Customs Administration registered, amended, consulted, used, combined, and disseminated outside the FSVÂ signals of suspected and established fraud and requests for information aboutÂ at least 244,273 persons and 30,000 entrepreneurs, including minors. Moreover, the AP noted thatÂ the Tax and Customs Administration have thus processed personal data including data on health, nationality, and criminal personal data within the meaning of Article 4 of the GDPR.
Furthermore, the AP establishedÂ that the Ministry is the controller for the processing of personal data in FSV by the Tax and Customs Administration, and therefore clarified that, where the Tax and Customs Administration is mentioned in the decision, the AP equatesÂ this with the Ministry.
Findings of the AP
Subsequently, the AP highlighted that, during the aforementioned period, the Tax and Customs Administration acted in violation of the principles of lawfulness, purpose specification, accuracy, and storage limitation by processing personal data in FSV.
Further to this, the AP added that pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR and Article 6 of the Personal Data ProtectionÂ Act ('the Act'), which applied before the entry into force of the GDPR, there was no basis for the processing of personal data in FSV and that the Tax and Customs Administration could not successfully invoke the 'legal obligation' as a basis for those processing operations, because there was no obligation to process signals of (possible) fraud and requests for information as counterinformation.
In addition, the AP provided that the processing in FSV was not necessary for the fulfilment of the public task of the Tax and Customs Administration to supervise compliance with the provisions of or pursuant to the tax and allowances legislation, as the principle of proportionality was not met because the infringement of the interests of the data subjects was disproportionate in relation to the purpose to be served by the processing, whereby the purposes of FSV were not well-defined and therefore unclear. In this context, the AP opined that the principle of subsidiarity was also not met because the aim pursued can be served in a different, less far-reaching way, namely without FSV or with the design of another more limited application.
Additionally, the AP noted that the preformulated purposes of collecting personal data in FSV were not well-defined in accordance with the principle of purpose specification under Article 5(1)(b) of the GDPR and Article 7 of the Act. Moreover, the AP outlinedÂ that pursuant to the principle of accuracy under Article 5(1)(d) of the GDPR and Article 11(2) of the Act there were incorrect and non-updated personal data in FSV and that the Tax and Customs Administration did not take reasonable measures to rectify or delete the personal data.
Likewise, the AP outlinedÂ that, contrary toÂ the principle of storage limitation, as laid down in Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR and Article 10(1) of the Act, the personal data in FSV were kept longer than the retention period applicable to the personal data in FSV by the Tax and Customs Administration. Furthermore, the AP provided that the Tax and Customs Administration acted in violation of Article 32(1) of the GDPR and Article 13 of the ActÂ as it had not taken adequate technical and organisational measures with regard to access security andÂ logging control, to ensure an appropriate level of security for the personal data in FSV.
Finally, the AP concluded that the Tax and Customs Administration did not properly and timely involve the data protection officer in the implementation of the Data Protection Impact AssessmentÂ of FSV, acting in violation of Articles 38(1) and 35(2) of the GDPR.
In its findings, the AP issued the following fines:
Outcomes

'''The Dutch data protection authority ('AP') announced, on 6 April 2022, its decision issued, onÂ 24 February 2022, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬565,000 on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ('the Ministry'), for violations of Articles 13(1)(e) and 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following an investigation conducted by the AP.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AP noted that it had carried out an investigation at the Ministry in accordance with the Schengen evaluation, which explicitly states that the AP must carry out regular checks at the Dutch consular. Moreover, the decision notes that these checks were a part of the police and judicial multi-year plan that the AP follows in the context of its supervision of, amongÂ other things, the Schengen Information System ('SIS II') and the Visa Information System ('VIS').
Furthermore, the AP outlined that the AP's investigation focused on the selected physical, organisational, and technical security aspects of the New Visa Information System ('NVIS') in the context of the Schengen visa process, and included the security plan, physical security, the granting of access rights to the NVIS,Â and the logging of the NVIS usage. In addition, the AP highlightedÂ that compliance with legal requirements was checked with regardsÂ to the provision of information to visa applicants and the training of employees involved in the visa process.
Findings of the AP
Subsequently, the AP notedÂ that the Ministry isÂ designated as a data controller of the NVIS, as, among other things, the MinistryÂ is responsible forÂ determining the purpose and means for the processing of personal data within the NVIS.
Further to this, the APÂ highlightedÂ that the Ministry hadÂ handled an average of 530,000 visa applications per year for the past three years, and that all of the personal data of the citizens from these applications are insufficiently secured. Moreover, the AP noted that the categories of data affectedÂ includeÂ sensitive data, and encompassÂ names, addresses, placesÂ of residence, country of birth, purpose of trip, nationality, photos, and fingerprints, which qualifies as biometric data.
In its findings, the AP came to the following conclusions:
Outcomes
In conclusion, the AP deemed it appropriate, in view of the seriousness of the violation, to impose a fine of â‚¬565,000 on the Ministry for acting in violation of Articles 13(1)(e) and 32(1) of the GDPR. Moreover, the AP ordered the Ministry to end the violationsÂ by takings appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
In addition, the AP imposed an order, subject to periodic penalty payments, for fixing the security provision (â‚¬50,000 every two weeks) and the information provision (â‚¬10,000 per week).

In addition, the decision outlinesÂ that the AP's investigation identified two main violations; namely, that the OLVG did not use this two-factor authentication within the hospital and that, although the OLVG was logging access of files by staff, it was not checkingÂ often enough for unauthorised access to files.

'''The Dutch data protection authority ('AP') announced, on 22 July 2021, its decision to impose a fine of â‚¬750,000 against TikTok Inc. In particular the decision outlines that TikTok, from 25 May 2018 to 28 July 2020, provided its privacy notice in EnglishÂ to Dutch users, including children,Â whichÂ violates Article 12(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') for failing to provideÂ an adequate explanation of how TikTok collects, processes, and uses personal data.
Moreover, the AP confirmed that the violations of the privacy statement fell outside the scope of Opinion 8/2019 on the Competence of a Supervisory Authority in Case of a Change in Circumstances Relating to the Main or Single Establishment (9 July 2019) as the violations ended before 29 July 2019, the date that TikTok headquartered in Ireland, and for that reason the AP remains authorised to take a decision for the violation and impose a sanction. However, the AP highlighted that it is transferring the various results of their investigations to the Irish Data Protection Authority to make a final decision.

'''The Dutch data protection authority ('AP') published, on 12 November 2021, its decision, as issued on 23 September 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬400,000 to Transavia Airlines C.V., for violation of Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') following a security breach.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AP noted that it received a breach notification from Transavia notifying that a malicious third party had gained unauthorised access to Transavia's systems, where the hacker had downloaded personal data of approximately 83,000 people, including the health data of 367 individuals. However, the AP noted that the hackerÂ was also able to view the personal data of 25 million passengers.Â Moreover, the AP highlighted that the hacker broke into Transavia's systems in September 2019, using two accounts of the company's IT department, which lasted until the end of November 2019 when Transavia closed the leak.
Findings of the AP
The AP found that, due to the large scale of the incident, a high volume of sensitive personal data was also processed and that, as such, the AP qualifies this breach of the GDPR as very serious.
Furthermore, the AP considered the hack to be too easy for the following reasons:
In addition, the AP emphasised that TransaviaÂ reported the breach to them in a timely manner and immediately took many measures to protect personal data, including introducing two-factor authentication for all end users and devices, amongÂ other things.
Outcomes
Finally, the AP noted that Transavia did not object to the fine and, therefore, the fine is final.

'''The Dutch data protection authority ('AP') published, on 17 July 2020, its report ('the Report') following its investigation into the processing of the nationality of applicants for childcare allowance by the Allowances Department of the Tax and Customs Administration ('the Allowances Department'), whereby it found such processing activities to be unlawful, discriminatory, and to result in serious violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Report outlines that the Allowances Department should have deleted data on dual citizenship in January 2014, but that, in May 2018, 1.4 million dual citizens were registered within the system and, although dual nationality does not play a role in assessment of childcare allowance applications, the data was stored and used. Furthermore, the Report indicates that the data was also used for purposes of combating fraud and automatically indicating the risk-level of certain applications, all of which are unlawful and constitute discriminatory processing.

'''The Dutch data protection authority ('AP') issued, on 1 February 2018, guidance in relation to its handling of cases where prior checking is necessary before the commencement of data processing operations, as well as in relation to codes of conduct submitted to the AP for its approval. In particular, the AP highlighted that, until 27 April 2018, it will examine requests on a case-by-case basis to determine how the issue can best be handled, but that from that date on, it will no longer be able to accept requests as it willÂ not have sufficient time to process the requests before the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') begins to apply.
In this respect, the AP noted that organisations willÂ instead be required to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') under the GDPR. The AP did, however, state that decisions it has already taken will remain valid after 25 May 2018, unless the circumstances regarding the particular data processing change.Â Finally, the APÂ highlighted that organisations willÂ no longer need to notify it of data processing activites except whenÂ a DPIA has indicated that the processing will result in a high risk andÂ the controller does not take steps to mitigate suchÂ risk.

'''The Court of Amsterdam ('the Court') issued, on 17 September 2019, a decision ('the Decision') on the data subject'sÂ right to be informed of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy, in the case that the data controller does not take action on a request of the same, in accordance with Article 12(4) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Decision outlines that, when the data subjectÂ is represented by a qualified expert, the data controller has noÂ obligation to inform the data subject on the possibility of lodging a complaintÂ since the qualified expert assisting the data subject does not need to be provided with that information. In addition, the Decision highlights that the right to be informed does not apply when the qualified expert is a legal person, sinceÂ Recital 39 of the GDPR explicitly refers to 'natural persons'.

'''The Court of AmsterdamÂ issued, on 11 June 2020, its decision in which it ruled that the University of Amsterdam ('UvA') is permitted to use online surveillance software during student exams and that the data collection practices complied with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Court of Amsterdam outlined that student councils had demanded that online proctoring be banned. However, the Court of Amsterdam found thatÂ theÂ UvAÂ wasÂ not required to obtainÂ theÂ consent of studentsÂ regarding invigilation of exams.
Furthermore, the Court of Amsterdam concluded that thereÂ wasÂ no unlawful invasion of privacy since theÂ UvA'sÂ data processing activities could rely upon the lawful basis of processing under Article 6(1) of the GDPR and, moreover, that theÂ UvAÂ hasÂ a public task as an educational institution and that, in the context of COVID-19 ('Coronavirus'), online proctoring is necessary to conduct exams from home. Specifically, the Court of Amsterdam noted that theÂ UvA'sÂ data handling procedures comply with the GDPR; for instance, theÂ UvAÂ had entered into a controller-processor agreement with the third-party software provider, ensured encryption of stored data, destroyedÂ data automatically after 30 days, andÂ guaranteedÂ its invigilators can only access the data when the computer detects significantly deviant behaviour.Â

'''The Gelderland Court ('the Court') issued, on 13 May 2020, its judgment on minors' photographs on social media under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679). In particular, the Court outlined that an individual ('the Defendant') had published photos of her daughter's ('the Claimant') children on Pinterest and Facebook which the Claimant requested to be removed. The Court held that it has not been sufficiently established how the Defendant's Facebook and Pinterest accounts had been set up or protected, or whether the photos could be found via a search engine such as Google. Furthermore, the Court ruled that, on Facebook, it could not be ruled out that the placed photos could be distributed and become the property of third parties. In view of these circumstances, the Court ruled that it had not become apparent that the Defendant was carrying out a purely personal or household activity and thus provisions of the GDPR apply.Â 
Moreover, the Court outlined that the General Data Protection Regulation Implementation Act 2018 stipulates that the posting of photos of minors who have not yet reached the age of 16 requires the permission of their legal representative and that the Claimant had not given such permission to the Defendant. Finally, the Court ordered the Defendant to remove the photos of the children from her social media within ten days of the judgment and proposed a fine of â‚¬50 payable to the Claimant for each day in violation. In addition, the Court banned the Defendant from posting, displaying, or otherwise distributing photos of the Claimant's children on social media, and proposed a fine of â‚¬50 for each day the Defendant breached such a ban.Â

Piltz added, ""[â€¦] The view that there is no obligation to provide information on, in particular, electronically stored notes on telephone calls and other conversations conducted with the data subject cannot be reconciled with the provisions of the GDPR, [â€¦] since statements by the data subject or statements about the data subject recorded in memos of conversations or telephone notes constitute data fully falling within the scope of the GDPR.

'''The Administrative Court of DÃ¼sseldorf ('the Court') issued, on 11 October 2021, its decision in proceedings 29 K 7031/19, in which it found a claim brought by the plaintiff against the North Rhine-Westphalia State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information ('LDI NRW') inadmissible, determining that the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') is not applicable to a proceeding concluded under the old Data Protection Act of North Rhine-Westphalia 2000 ('DSG NRW 2000'), if no action was pending at the time of entry into force of the GDPR.
In particular, the Court reported that the plaintiff had been sentenced to probation for tax evasion by a District Court and thatÂ following an alleged disclosure by the latter of the court files to third parties, including the press, the plaintiff had filed a complaint with the LDI NRW, which had later dismissed the same. Additionally, according to the DSG NRW 2000, the Court only had supervisory jurisdiction over courts insofar as they performed administrative tasks, and that the forwarding of the court files to the press did not fall within such area. As such, following the entry into force of the GDPR, the plaintiff had filed a claim with the Court claiming a legal remedy against the LDI NRW pursuant to Article 78 of the GDPR.
Therefore, the Court held that the plaintiff was precluded from recourse to the GDPR, as the process in connection with his initial complaint filed with the LDI NRW had already been completed at the time of the entry into force of the GDPR, so that the same did not apply to the case in question. As a result, the Court posited that there was no requirement for a judgment on the merits and considered the action inadmissible. Moreover, the Court emphasised that neither the GDPR nor the new Data Protection Law North Rhine-Westphalia 2018 contain any provision that completed proceedings, decided under an old data protection law, can be subjectedÂ to a retrospective assessment by a supervisory authority, and that the same cannot be deduced from any general principles of the GDPR.

'''The District Court of Cologne issued, on 16 February 2022, its judgment in Case No. 28 O 303/20, in which it ordered S KÃ¶ln L GmbH und Co. KG to provide the plaintiff with a copy, in a common electronic format, of their personal data, for violations of Articles 12(3), 15(1), and 15(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint lodged by an individual.
Background to the judgment
In particular, the District Court reported that the plaintiff had a contractual relationship with S KÃ¶ln L for the rental of a virtual office. In addition, the District Court noted that, following the relocation of the plaintiff's virtual office to another centre owned by S KÃ¶ln L and issues with the fee payments, the plaintiff had asked S KÃ¶ln L to obtain access to their personal data. Subsequently, the District Court outlined while that S KÃ¶ln L had provided the plaintiff with information on their personal data as per Article 15(1) of the GDPR, although belatedly, it had not provided the plaintiff with a copy of the personal data as per Article 15(3) of the GDPR.Â Further to this, the District Court stated that the plaintiff had requested the District Court to order S KÃ¶ln L to provide the plaintiff with a copy of their personal data.
Findings of the District Court
Further to the above, the District Court clarified that Article 15(3) of the GDPR grants data subjects an independent right to obtain a copy of their personal data and thatÂ this right supplements the right of access pursuant to Article 15(1) of the GDPR and is not identical to it. In addition, the District Court specified that the spirit and purpose of Article 15(3) of the GDPR speaks in favour of an independent claim for the release of a copy of the raw version of the processed personal data, since this is the only way for the data subject to assess the scope and content of the data held by the controller.
On this basis, the District Court considered that the plaintiff's initial request encompassed both a request to access information on their personal data held by S KÃ¶ln L as well as a request to obtain a copy of the same. However, the District Court determiendÂ that, upon receiving such request, the defendant had only provided the plaintiff with information in accordance with Article 15(1) of the GDPR, but not with a copy of the data in the raw version, in line with the meaning of Article 15(3) of the GDPR.
Thus, the District Court found that S KÃ¶ln L was in violation of the GDPR, as the same had not provided the plaintiff with information pursuant to Article 15(1) of the GDPR within the one-month period pursuant to Article 12(3) of the GDPR, and, in addition, had not provided the plaintiff with a copy of their personal data, in accordance with Article 15(3) of the GDPR.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the District Court ordered S KÃ¶ln L to provide the plaintiff with a copy of their personal data, to be made available in a common electronic format, since the plaintiff had submitted the initial request in such a manner. Lastly, the District Court highlighted that the appeal against the judgment may be lodged before the Cologne Higher Regional Court within one month.

'''The Norwegian data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') published, on 11 January 2022, its decision in 21/00480-14, as issued on 7 January 2022, in which it imposed a fine of NOK 4,000,000
Background to the decision 
In particular, the Datatilsynet stated that the Ã˜stre Toten municipality had been the subject of a ransomware attack in January 2021, which had resulted in the employees being unable to access most of the municipality's IT systems, the encryption of the municipality's data, and theÂ deletion of backups. In addition, the Datatilsynet noted that, in March 2021, it became known that parts of the data had been published on the dark web, and the Ã˜stre Toten municipality had estimated that approximately 30,000 documents were covered by the attack. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet stated that the documents had partly containedÂ sensitive information about the municipality's residents and employees.
Findings of the Datatilsynet 
In particular, the Datatilsynet found that the Ã˜stre Toten municipality had deficiencies in, among other things, log and log analysisÂ and in securing backup, as well as lackingÂ two-factor authentication, or similar security measures, and protection of backup copies against intentional and unintentional deletion, manipulation, and reading. In addition, the Datatilsynet stated that the deficiencies showed a weakness in the Ã˜stre Toten municipality's ability to identify hacker attacks, as well as having inadequate information security in the system. Hence, the Datatilsynet stated that this in itself constituted a breach of the requirements for personal data security set out inÂ Article 32 of the GDPR.
Furthermore, the Datatilsynet stated that the ransomware attack was particularly serious because it had affected a significant part of the Ã˜stre Toten municipality's data, and the latter had completely lost control over the personal data and information shared on the dark web to an unknown extent. Moreover, the Datatilsynet noted that, as a result of the inadequate information security measuresÂ and the management's and employees' lack of awareness of possible security threats and data attacks, the Ã˜stre Toten municipality had violated the basic principle of the duty to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of information under Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR.
However, the Datatilsynet stated that the Ã˜stre Toten municipality's financial situation had an impact on its calculation of the fine, as it had to spend large sums on restoring the IT system and ensuring adequate information security as a result of the ransomware attack. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet emphasised that the Ã˜stre Toten municipality had cooperated extensively with the supervisory authorities, the police, residents, and employees after the attack had been discovered.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Datatilsynet imposed the aforementioned fine of NOK 4,000,000 (approx. â‚¬402,820) to Ã˜stre Toten municipality and ordered it to implement appropriateÂ personal data security measures. Finally, the Datatilsynet stated that theÂ Ã˜stre Toten municipality can appeal the decision within three weeks after it has received the decision.

Further to this, Datatilsynet highlighted that the use of such app entailed location tracking, possible processing of special categories of personal data and systematic monitoring, and that, therefore, before its use, a DPIA was required. In addition, Datatilsynet found that the Municipality, apart from failing to conduct a DPIA, had not established specific procedures for risk assessment in respect to the downloading and use of certain apps.

Background to the decision
In particular, the Datatilsynet noted that its decision relates toÂ complaints from twoÂ data subjectsÂ who had been credit assessed by a company without any kind of prior customer relationship or other connection toÂ saidÂ company.
Findings of the Datatilsynet

'''The Norwegian data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') published, on 7 January 2022, its decision in case No. 20/04401-11, as issued on 13 December 2021, in which it imposed a fine of NOK 250,000 (approx. â‚¬24,950) to Elektro & Automasjon Systemer AS ('EAS'), which was subsequently reduced to NOK 200,000 (approx. â‚¬19,960), for violations of Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint regarding the processing of personal data in a credit assessment without legal basis.
Background to the decision 
In particular, the Datatilsynet stated that it had, on 18 November 2020, received a complaint from the data subject concerning the fact that EAS had carried out a credit assessment of the data subject even though the data subject had no cooperation, customer relationship, or other connection to EAS's business and hence had no expectation to be credit rated by EAS. In addition, the Datatilsynet noted that EAS had confirmed that the data subject was not a customer and had no other direct relationship with EAS, and that the credit check of the data subject must have taken place by mistake due to the general manager's lack of understanding of Bisnode AB's credit assessment tool. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet stated that the EAS had reported that it had been in contact with Bisnode to explain the credit assessment tool after the EAS had received the Datatilsynet's requirement for a report. Moreover, the Datatilsynet stated that it had sent a notice of a decision on orders and fees on 17 June 2021 and that EAS had submitted comments to this notice on 20 July 2021.
Findings of the Datatilsynet 
In particular, the Datatilsynet stated that the requirement of legitimate interest in Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR was not met, hence EAS did not have a legal basis to process the data subject's credit information. In addition, the Datatilsynet clarified that even though EAS did not store the credit information in the company, the damage occurs the moment credit information is collected and processed by someone without a legal basis for processing. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet highlighted that credit information is a type of personal information that is particularly worthy of protection and individuals have an expectation that such data is not collected by companies, unless it is objectively justified in their relationship with them. Thus, the Datatilsynet clarified that EAS's violation was serious in nature since the data subject did not have any relationship with EAS that would have made it foreseeable that EAS would process credit information about the data subject. Moreover, the Datatilsynet stated that EAS, through its general manager, has shown negligence in obtaining credit information. Lastly, the Datatilsynet highlighted that other aggravating factors included, among other things, the lack of technical and organisational measures for compliance with the privacy regulations, and lack of knowledge about the credit assessment tool and guidelines for when credit assessment can be carried out.
Outcomes
The Datatilsynet reduced the fine due to EAS's financial situation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and imposed the aforementioned fine of NOK 200,000Â (approx. â‚¬19,960) to the EAS for having obtained credit information without a legal basis. In addition, the Datatilsynet ordered the EAS to improve its internal control and routines for credit assessments to prevent illegal credit checks from occurring again.
EAS has three weeks to appeal the decision.

'''The Norwegian data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') announced, on 11 February 2022, that it had imposed a fine of NOK 50,000 (approx. â‚¬4,917) to Etterforsker1 Gruppen A/S, a private investigations company,Â for violations regarding legal basis, following a complaint sumbitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the Datatilsynet noted that it had received a complaint from an individual who had been credit assessed without any kind of customer relationship or other affiliation withÂ Etterforsker1. In addition, the Datatilsynet stated that in this case, Etterforsker1 had performed the credit assessment on behalf of a customer who was alleged to have a claim for damages against the complainant. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet outlined thatÂ Etterforsker1 stated that the purpose of the credit assessment was to implement the agreement with its customer and examine the complainant's financial situation in order to assess any legal steps.Â 
Findings of the Datatilsynet 
In particular, the Datatilsynet stated that when a credit assessment has been performed with a view to examining a customer's creditworthiness before entering into an agreement, the business should normally have a legal basis. In addition, the Datatilsynet emphasised that the activities of a private investigator must be assessed differently from an ordinary law practice where a lawyer represents a client. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet stated that Etterforsker1Â acknowledges that it lacked a legal basis for the credit assessment in this case. Moreover, the Datatilsynet noted that a credit rating is the result of compiling personal information from many different sources, and it will also show details about individuals' personal finances such as any payment remarks, voluntary mortgages, and debt ratio. Lastly, the Datatilsynet held that the GDPR requires that all processing of personal data has a legal basis.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Datatilsynet ordered a fine of NOK 50,000 to Etterforsker1Â for violation regarding legal basis. In addition, the Datatilsynet stated that the Etterforsker1 has three weeks to appeal the decision from the time it receives the decision.Â

Findings of the Datatilsynet 
In particular, the Datatilsynet considered that user's consent was required in order to share the personal data, but that the so-called consent Grindr collected was not valid. In addition, the Datatilsynet noted that users had to accept the privacy statement in its entirety in order to use the app but they were not specifically asked if they would consent to disclosure to third parties for marketing purposes. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that information about the disclosure of personal data was not clear or accessible enough to users. Hence, the Datatilsynet highlighted that this violated the GDPR consent requirements.
Additionally, the Datatilsynet stated that information that someone is a Grindr user is a special category of personal data, because it strongly indicates that they belong to a sexual minority and data about someone's sexual orientation has a special protection in the GDPR. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet clarified that since the consent collected by Grindr was invalid, Grindr was not legally permitted to share the data. Moreover, the Datatilsynet highlighted that location data is also sensitive and personal, although it is not defined as special categories of personal data, and it is serious that Grindr had also shared this data illegally.
Outcomes

Background to the decision 
In particular, the Datatilsynet stated that LillestrÃ¸m municipality had published a document in its public postal journal where ten of 21 attachments contained sensitive personal data, however, LillestrÃ¸m municipality forgot to mark the ten relevant attachments as they should. In addition, the Datatsilynet stated that the error was not detected by the case officer, and even though the document went through two more manual quality checks in the documentation centre the error was not detected. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that LillestrÃ¸m municipality was made aware that the document with attachments was made available on the municipality's website on 27 September 2021 by a journalist in Romerikes Blad. Moreover, the Datatilsynet stated that LillestrÃ¸m municipality notified the breach of personal data security to the Datatilsynet on 29 September 2021.
Findings of the Datatilsynet 
In particular, the Datatilsynet stated that investigations showed that four different IP addresses, including Romerikes Blad, had accessed the document. However, the Datatilsynet outlined that the documents were removed from the mailing list and exempted from public access immediately after the incident was discovered and the affected data subjects were then notified. In addition, the Datatilsynet stated that it is clear that LillestrÃ¸m municipality failed to implement sufficient level of security, or that it did not work as intended since a document with an appendix about a student was published on LillestrÃ¸m municipality's website. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet stated that the fact that the incident was not detected by LillestrÃ¸m municipality, but by a third party, also indicates deficient procedures in this area.
Moreover, the Datatilsynet stated that the incident breached Article 32(1)(b) of the GDPR, which requires the establishment of a level of security that is suitable for ensuring continued confidentiality. However, the Datatilsynet noted that in this case personal information that should have been protected had been made available to unauthorised persons on the internet. Lastly, the Datatilsynet outlined that it had previously sent a notice of infringement fines of NOK 500,000 (approx. â‚¬50,140), however LillestrÃ¸m municipality had pointed out in its response to the notice of fee that they have procedures in place, and that the discrepancy was due to human error.

In addition, the Datatilsynet notedÂ that there are no technical measures to prevent communication of special category personal data, such as health data, regarding the children, and that no information is given within the app that such transmission should be avoided.Â Moreover, the Datatilsynet noted that the the app contained well-known security vulnerabilities prior to its launch, due to inadequate security testing, and that inadequate login security made it possible for unauthorised persons to access and alter the personal data of more than 63,000 pupils.
Furthermore, the Datatilsynet initially notified its intent to impose a fine of â‚¬200,000 in response to the findings above. However, theÂ final amount of the fine was reduced to â‚¬120,000 as the MunicipalityÂ had implemented measures to limit the damages as soon as it was made aware of the security issues, andÂ showedÂ willingness to resolve the issues.

'''The Norwegian data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') announced, 11 May 2021, that it had fined the NorwegianÂ Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports ('NIF') NOK 1.2 million (approx. â‚¬124,430) for disclosing the personal information of 3.2 million individuals online for 87 days following an error which occurred when testing a cloud solution. In particular, the Datatilsynet outlined that the exposed personal information included names, dates of birth, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet highlighted that, of the 3.2 million individuals affected, 486,447 were children aged between 3-17 years old. However, the Datatilsynet noted that it does not have information to suggestÂ that unauthorised individuals have exploited the information.
The Datatilsynet found that the NIF had initiated testing before conducting a sufficient risk assessment and without implementing specific routines or measures to secure the information. Additionally, the Datatilsynet outlined that testing could have been carried out by processing synthetic data, or by using fewer personal data, and therefore held that there was no legal basis for the testing and that the principles of legality, data minimisation and confidentiality had also been breached.

'''The Norwegian data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') published, on 2 June 2022, its decision in 20/02875-10, as issued on 16 May 2022, in which it imposed a fine of NOK 150,000 (approx. â‚¬14,855) to the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority, for violation of Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint.
Background to the decision 
In particular, the Datatilsynet stated that the background for the decision is a complaint from a person who runs a sole proprietorship who was to assist a company with services, including assistance with a so-called postal inspection of the Norwegian Labor Inspection Authority. In addition, the Datatilsynet noted that after the complainant had contacted the Norwegian Labor Inspection Authority in this context, the complainant had received a letter informing them that their sole proprietorship had been credit-rated by the Norwegian Labor Inspection Authority. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet outlined that the credit assessment was made because the complainant's sole proprietorship had assisted and sold services to a company that the Norwegian Labor Inspection Authority had under its supervision and wanted to investigate further.
Findings of the Datatilsynet
In particular, the Datatilsynet found that the complaints were not 'subject to supervision' under Section 18-5 of the Working Environment Act of 17 June 2005, hence the Datatilsynet concluded that the Norwegian Labor Inspection Authority had no legal basis to make such a credit assessment.
Outcomes
As a result, the Datatilsynet fined the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority NOK 150,000 (approx. â‚¬14,855). Furthermore, the Datatilsynet highlighted that the Norwegian Labor Inspection Authority has a three-weekÂ appeal period from the time they receive the decision.

In particular,Â DatatilsynetÂ noted that a credit rating results from the compilation of personal data from different sources indicating the probability that a person or sole proprietorship will pay a debt. More specifically,Â DatatilsynetÂ highlighted credit information about a sole proprietorship constitutes personal data as the owner is directly identified by the company and the company's finances are directly linked to the owner's personal finances. Therefore, for the processing of such information, there must be a legal basis which did not exist in this case.Â

Background to the decision 
In particular, the Datatilsynet noted that T. Stene Transport had not previously used the credit rating tool.
Findings of the Datatilsynet
In particular, the Datatilsynet held that credit information about a sole proprietorship also constitutes personal data, as the owner is immediately identified with the enterprise, and the enterprise is directly linked to the owner's personal finances. In addition, the Datatilsynet noted that a valid legal basis is required to subject sole proprietorships to a credit rating.Â 
Outcomes
In light of the above, the Datatilsynet imposed a fine of NOK 40,000 (approx. â‚¬4,000) to T. Stene Transport. Moreover, the Datatilsynet ordered the company to establish procedures for when it is appropriate to perform a credit rating, even though they did not routinely perform credit ratings.

In particular, the Datatilsynet stated that credit information is a type of personal information that is particularly worthy of protection,Â and noted that the relevant basis for processing the collection of credit informationÂ is under Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). However, the Datatilsynet stated that in this case, the company did not have a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR in assessing the complainant's credit rating because, among others, the complainant had no expectation that Ultra-Technology would process his/her credit information.

'''The Norwegian data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') announced, on 16 January 2021, that it had notified its intention to fine Grindr LLCÂ NOK 100 million (approx. â‚¬10 million) for its failure to comply with the rules on consent under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)Â ('GDPR'). In particular, DatatilsynetÂ found that Grindr had failed to obtain freely given, specific, unambiguous, and informed consent for the sharing of data, thereby violating Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR.Â Specifically, Datatilsynet highlighted that Grindr did not obtain adequate consentÂ for profiling and sharing of data, including GPS and user profiles,Â with third parties for marketing purposes.
Furthermore, Datatilsynet considered that Grindr had not adequately informed users about the sharing of their personal data, alongside finding that Grindr's choice to bundle users' consent with agreeing to the general privacy policy had not allowed users to give separate consent for a different purpose of processing, such as processing of data for marketing purposes. In addition, Datatilsynet considered that making access to the free version of the app dependent on whether the user agreed to the sharing of personal data, coupled with insufficient mechanisms for opting-out, meant that providing Grindr services was conditional upon consent to the processing of personal data, thereby violating the requirement of free consent. Moreover, Datatilsynet held that the lack of clarity with respect to whether the data subject was consenting to sharing personal data for marketing purposes when accepting the privacy policy meant that consent was not unambiguous.
Lastly, Datatilsynet disagreed with Grindr's argument that it does not reveal the sexual orientation of data subjects, finding, in particular, that the processing of data concerning sexual orientation would fall under Article 9 of the GDPR on special categories of data, and therefore Grindr had breached the processing prohibition of Article 9(1) of the GDPR when disclosing to advertising partners personal data linked with the app name or the keywords ""gay, bi, trans, and queer"".Â

Background to the decision
In particular, the ANPD stated that, on 17 October 2021, a television report had been broadcasted,Â which alleged that the Superintendence had inappropriately processed the data of individuals by making copies of migratory reports and passports and shared this information with its employeesÂ through insecure networks. Furthermore, the ANPD noted that following this television report, an investigation was conducted into the alleged actions in violation of the Law.
Findings of the ANPD
Following the investigation, the ANPD found that the Superintendence did not guarantee the confidentiality of individuals' personal data, as this information was shared with employees through WhatsApp on their personal mobile phones. In addition, the ANPD held that the Superintendence had not implemented the necessary security measures to restrict generatingÂ copies of personal information.
In summary, the ANPD found the Superintendence in violation of the Law and the Regulation for failure to maintain the confidentiality of personal information, as well as for carrying out the processing of sensitive personal data with insufficientÂ security measures.
Outcomes
As a result of the above findings, the ANPD imposed the aforementioned fine andÂ ANPD imposed corrective measures, including:
In addition, the decision provides, among other things, that the corrective measures must be complied with within 55 business days from the notification of the decision to the Superintendence, and that the fine must be paid within 25 business days from the notification of the decision to the Superintendence.

Background to the resolution
In particular, the ANPD noted that the resolution was issued as a result of the claim presented by a citizen regarding unsolicited marketing calls and their request ofÂ cancellation of their personal telephone number in the database of Oncosalud.Â Furthermore, the ANPD detailed that OncosaludÂ contracted a company, linked to its economic group, which provides sales services for its products, and subsequently, the latter subcontracted the serviceÂ to a call centreÂ which made the marketing calls to the complainant.Â 
Findings of the ANPD
In this context, the ANPDÂ pointed out that this subcontracting does not exempt OncosaludÂ from its responsibilities towards its customers and their rights. In particular, the ANPD explained that Oncosalud is to be considered as the data controller and has the primary obligation to preserve the lawfulness of the processing of personal data, since processing is necessary to meet its interests, and must therefore diligently exercise control over it and be able to demonstrate such control at all times. Therefore, the ANPD stated that OncosaludÂ committed the infringement set outÂ in Article 132.2(b) of the RegulationÂ for processing personal data without the free, express, unambiguous, prior, and informed consent of the data subject.
Outcomes

In addition to this, the Statement notes that national security has not been defined in the Polish Constitution of 2 AprilÂ 1997, and proceeds with giving a broad interpretation to the same, including the processing of personal data in an emergency epidemic by public administration bodies and by other entities implementing public tasks, in order to prevent and combat Coronavirus.

Background to the caseÂ 
In particular, the resolution states that the bank's courier lost correspondence with personal data, such as name, surname, identity card number, registration address, bank account numbers, and identification number given to the bank's customers. Moreover, the resolution explains that the bank did notify the data subjects about this breach, but the information included did not meet the requirements set out in Article 34(2) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the resolution details that the bank did not consider the data breach likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, and therefore it did not report the breach to the supervisory authority, failing to comply with ArticleÂ 33 of GDPR.
Findings of the UODO
In addition, the UODO reminded that it is necessary to report to the supervisory authorityÂ those incidents in which there is a probability (higher than low) of a harmful impact on the rights or freedoms of data subjects, and that when this risk is high, the breach must also be notified to the data subjects. InÂ particular, the UODO highlighted that these risks include identity theft or falsification, financial loss, or reputational damage, and that the wide range of data contained in the correspondence may have exposed those affected by the incident to such consequences.
Outcomes
Lastly, in the decision in question, the supervisory authority not only imposed a fine of PLN 363,000 (approx. â‚¬78,000) to the bank but also ordered the bank to notify the persons affected by the breach in the manner specified in ArticleÂ 34 (2) GDPR.

Furthermore, the decision notes that, as a result of this violation, data subjects,Â for an extended time periodÂ were not aware ofÂ the risk of their data being used by unauthorised persons, meaning that they could not take any actions that would limit the risk of identity theft.

In particular, the UODO noted that the company had not responded to indications about security gaps and that an unauthorised person had subsequently copied and deleted the data in the company's server also demanding a ransom. More specifically, the UODO had established that the breach had taken place following a failed attempt to restore appropriate security configuration and that the controller, despite being notified about the vulnerability from cybersecurity specialists, failed to exercise due diligence with respect to its security systems and its processor. In addition, the UODO noted that controllers should be able to identify breaches quickly and effectively to take appropriate action as well as investigate the incident and take appropriate remedial action. Moreover, the UODO highlighted that the lack of quick response by the processor does not reduce the controller's responsibility for the data breach and that, in calculating the fine, it took into consideration, among others, the scale of the breach and the controller's delay in taking appropriate remedial action.

'''The Polish data protection authority ('UODO') announced, on
Background to the decision
In particular, the UODO outlined that they received information about a possible data breach from the Patient's Rights Ombudsman, whereby an individual received a referral from a doctor which contained the personal data of another patient, including health data. Moreover, the UODO highlighted that, following this incident, the doctor did not notify either the UODO or the affected individual about this incident, as they believed the personal data in the referral related to a person who did not exist in reality. Furthermore, the UODO noted that while the Medical University of Warsaw qualified this as a security incident after the Ombudsman brought it to their attention, they did not consider it to have a significant impact on the rights or obligations of the data subject and so did not notify either the UODO or the patient in question.
Findings of the UODO
In relation to the above, the UODO disregarded the notion that the incident technically concerned a non-existent person due to an error in the patient information. Specifically, the UODO stated that while the referral contained a typo on behalf of the patient, other personal data such as name, address, and PESEL number meant that they could easily be identified.
In addition, the UODO determined that there was in fact a high risk to the rights of the data subject, due to the presence of health data. Moreover, the UODO added that the disclosure of the personal data of the patient to an unauthorised person was a breach of medical confidentiality. Furthermore, the UODO concluded that the Medical University of Warsaw deliberately failed to notify both them and the affected individual, despite both the Ombudsman and the UODO contacting them in regards to the incident.
Outcomes 
As a result of the above, the UODO issued a fine of PLN 10,000 (approx. â‚¬2,120) against the Medical University of Warsaw and also ordered the same to notify the affected individual about the breach within three days from the decision becoming final.

Background to the decision
In particular, the UODO commenced its investigation, following notification of a data breach from Fortum, the data controller, which concerned the copying of a customer database by unauthorised third parties. The UODO noted that the data breach happened when changes were introduced in the ICT environment by PIKA, as the server on which the database was deployed lacked appropriate configuration to ensure the security of data transmission from the new server to other ICT elements of the Fortum environment used to process personal data.
Findings of the UODO
The UODO found that PIKA did not take all measures required under Article 32 of the GDPR to ensure the security of data processing and did not help Fortum to fulfil its obligation as specified under this provision, which, in turn, resulted in the data breach. Additionally, the UODO found that PIKA had neither encrypted nor pseudonymised the data stored in the database, and had, therefore, acted inconsistently with ISO standards, as well against its own security policy which rereferred to these standards.

PLN 545,748 (approx. â‚¬120,190), for violations of Article 34(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a data breach.
Background to the decision
In particular, the UODO stated that it had received a notification of a data breach at SantanderÂ Bank Polska,Â which affected 10,500 individuals and concerned a former employee of the bank, who had not been deprived of access to the ZUS Electronic Services Platform ('PUE ZUS') after the termination of their employment, and had unauthorised access to this platform, as a result of which they could view the data of employees, including their names, surnames, andÂ PESEL numbers. Additionally, the UODO noted that SantanderÂ Bank Polska did not notify the data subjects of this data breach because it claimed that it did not pose a high risk to their rights and freedoms, and instead posted a generic message on the internal communication platform specifying rules for data processing and types of infringements, without informing about the data breach in question.
Findings of the UODO
Following its investigation, the UODO found that access to such a wide scope of data poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, as data processed on the PUE ZUS platform may be used by unauthorised individuals to gain access to healthcare services and access health data, or to obtain data by third parties that allow them to take loans from non-bank institutions, among other things. As such, the UODO found that Santander Bank Polska violated Article 34(1) of the GDPR.

Specifically, UODO highlights that it is unlawful to process personal data on the basis of consent when another legal basis already authorises the controller to carry out the processing. Moreover, UODO outlined that, when consent is forced, such as when it is bundled in other contract clauses, it must be considered unlawful.

In particular, the decision relates to the Municipality's conduct in collecting the personal data of protestors, including sensitive personal data,Â when they apply for protests, and sharingÂ suchÂ data internally and externallyÂ withÂ third parties.Â 
Findings of the CNPD
Notably, the CNPD found that the Municipality, in sending notice of protest demonstrations, containing the personal data of protestors, to external third party entities, internal services, and advisors of the City Council, it had processed sensitive personal data without a legal basis. Furthermore, the CNPD found that the Municipality had undertaken the processing without informing the relevant data subjects, without defining a policy of conservation of their personal data, and without having carried out a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA')Â as required in this situation.Â 
In this regard, the CNPDÂ specifiedÂ that the â‚¬1.25 million fine is the sum of 225 fines fromÂ different violationsÂ theÂ Municipality's conduct had had amounted to since 2018, namely:
Moreover, with regards to the numerous fines, the CNPD noted that the duration of the violations and the number of data subjects affected serve as factors that aggravate the fines as they reveal a persistent lack of commitment to the legal obligations that theÂ MunicipalityÂ was supposed to fulfil.Â 
The CNPD further noted that the fines attached to each violation areÂ listedÂ inÂ pointÂ 255 to 266 of the decision.Â

Ultimately, the decision notes that theÂ fine ofÂ â‚¬1.25 million becomes final and enforceable if it is not judicially challenged by theÂ Municipality, and mustÂ be paidÂ within a maximum period of ten days after it is finalised, with the respective payment slips being sent to the CNPD.Â

In particular, Piltz commented, ""The case concerns a dispute [â€¦] as to whether the plaintiff has been effectively appointed as the data protection officer ('DPO') of the defendant in the past, [where] the plaintiff actedÂ in the function as the chairman of a works council. In 2017, [â€¦] the competent data protection authority [claimed] that the appointment of the company DPO must, among other things, be based on the principle of reliability of the DPO.""
Piltz added, ""The Court assumes that the plaintiff was effectively appointed as the DPO of the defendant. The objection that the invalidity of the plaintiff's appointment as DPO,Â [following]Â from the fact that the plaintiff does not have the necessary reliability, due to an incompatibility with the office of works council chairman, is not decisive, according to the Court. The Court refers to a decision of the Federal Labour Court, [issued] on 23 March 2011 (No. 10 AZR 562/09), [which] stated that mere membership in the works council does not make a person unreliable for the office of DPO, and that there is no fundamental incompatibility between these two positions.""
Lastly, Piltz stated, ""There is no substantive or detailed examination of the question of when a conflict of interest exists and whether the requirements have been met. According to Article 38(6) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), the DPO may fulfil 'other tasks and duties.' But the organisation must ensure that 'any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests.' According to the European Data Protection Board, the DPO cannot hold a position within the organisation that leads him/her to determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. In the present case, the Court could have assessed whether such a determination of purposes and means of the processing would be possible for the chair of the works council.""

In addition, MAS found that enhanced monitoring of higher-risk customers had not been conducted by Asiaciti Trust Singapore.
MAS noted that Asiaciti Trust Singapore has paid the penalty in full and taken remedial actions to address the risk management deficiencies that led to the breaches.
Ms Loo Siew Yee, Assistant Managing Director (Policy, Payments & Financial Crime), MAS, stated, ''Financial institutions must play their part in detecting and disrupting attempts to abuse our financial system for illicit purposes.

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') published, on 14 July 2022, its decision in Case No. DP-2106-B8421, in which it imposed a fine of SGD 10,000 (approx. â‚¬7,100) on Audio House Marketing Pte. Ltd., for violation of Section 24(a) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'), following a data breach.
Background to the decision 
In particular, the PDPC noted that on 1 June 2022, it received a data breach notification from Audio House, alertingÂ that its customer database had suffered an incident, affecting approximately 98,000 individuals, with information affected including names, email addresses, telephone numbers, and other contact information.
Findings of the PDPC
Following the PDPC's investigation, Audio House admitted that the vulnerability used to access the relevant files had existed since its website launched in April 2017, and that aside from functionality testing, Audio House did not conduct any vulnerability scanning and assessments that would have discovered the vulnerabilities which were exploited. Moreover, the PDPC outlined that although Audio House constructed the website through a third party, Audio House nonetheless failed to stipulate personal data protection requirements, clarify job specifications, and exercise reasonable oversight to provide adequate protection to personal data. Accordingly, the PDPC stated thatÂ Audio House was found to be in violation of Section 24(a) of the PDPA.
In reaching its decision, the PDPC considered that Audio House voluntarily admitted the breach and took prompt remedial actions, including disabling the use of its website the day of the incident.
Outcomes 
In light of the above, the PDPC imposed a fine of SGD 10,000 (approx. â‚¬7,100) on Audio House, which is required to make the payment within 30 days from the date of notice. In addition, the PDPC noted that, in view of the remedial actions already taken, the PDPC will not issue any further directions.

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') issued, on 11 October 2017, its decision against Aviva Ltd, a multinational insurer, for breach of the protection obligation under Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 ('PDPA'), which requires organisations to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data from unauthorised disclosure. The PDPC found that the personal data involved could be considered sensitive,Â and highlighted that even though there is no specific definition ofÂ such data under the PDPA, past decisions and guidelines have underscored that certain types of data would require a higher standard of protection.
Since Aviva's standard operating procedures did not include any second-level checks, this meant that there was no oversight of the actions of processing staff, and, as such, reasonable security arrangements were not in place. In addition, Aviva's data protection policy was found to be wanting. The PDPC ultimately ordered Aviva to pay SGD 6,000 (approx. â‚¬3,700), having taken into account a number of mitigating factors including the scale of the disclosure, that Aviva had notified the affected victim, and the fact that there was no evidence of damage resulting from the disclosure.Â

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') announced, on 14 October 2021, that it had fined ChampionTutor Inc.

Furthermore, the PDPC noted that ChampionTutor has been aware of the data breach since December 2020, but failed to take active steps to fix the vulnerability, resulting in a violation of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'). However, the PDPC's decision to levy the fine was based on factors listed under Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, namely that ChampionTutor voluntarily admitted liability and acted promptly to implement remedial actions, thereby reducing the time and resources needed for investigation.

In particular, the PDPC found that Chizzle had failed to conduct a security review, which could reasonably have prevented unauthorised entry into Chizzle'sÂ database.
In addition, the PDPC directed Chizzle to pay a fine of SGD 8,000 (approx. â‚¬5,300), and, among other things, to conduct a security audit, rectify any security gaps identified in the App and accompanying IT system, as well as to develop an IT security policy to guide its employees.

Background to the decision 
In particular, the PDPC highlighted that it received a notification from Cognita, on 16 June 2021, of a ransomware attack, which occurred on 13 June 2021, affecting three schools run by Cognita. More specifically, the PDPC noted that the ransomware attack encrypted the personal data of 1,260 individuals, of which 1,195 were students, with affected personal data including copies of identification/passports, salaries of employees, and the bank details of employees.
Findings of the PDPC
Following its investigation, the PDPC outlined that Cognita required a higher level of security and access controls to its administrator accounts, such as multifactor authentication. Likewise, the PDPC detailed that Cognita failed to have reasonable password policies or compliance with existing ones, alongside the absence of personal data protection training for staff. Accordingly, the PDPC found that Cognita breached Section 24 of the PDPA owing to the absence of suitable security measures.

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') published, on 11 November 2021, its decision in Case No. DP-2009-B7057, as issued on 15 September 2021, in which it imposed a financial penalty of SGD 74,000 (approx. â‚¬47,760) to Commeasure Pte. Ltd. for violations of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA').
Background to the case
In particular, the PDPC noted that it had received, on 25 September 2020, a data breach notification from Commeasure that its database containing 5,892,843 customer records had been accessed and exfiltrated. Following investigations, the PDPC revealed that an unknown threat actor had most likely gained access to the database, which was hosted by a third party service provider, by obtaining an access key that was made publicly available. More specifically, the PDPC observed that Commeasure had erroneously marked the access key as a 'test' key, which had not been captured by the company's security review and penetration testing.
Findings of the PDPC
As such, the PDPC found that Commeasure failed to undertake reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, as per the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA. Furthermore, the PDPC highlighted that while the database was hosted by a third party, Commeasure nevertheless remained in control of the database and was ultimately responsible for the root cause of the breach. In addition, the PDPC stated that Commeasure had not followed best practices for managing access keys and that its IT security reviews were not sufficiently rigorous.
Outcomes
In imposing the aforementioned penalty, the PDPC considered a number of mitigating factors, including Commeasure's cooperation in the course of investigations and the remedial actions implemented after the incident. Notably, the PDPC also noted that Commeasure had been severely impacted by COVID-19, as a business operating in the hospitality industry. Finally, the PDPC confirmed that Commeasure is required to pay the penalty within 30 days from the date of the relevant notice.

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') published, on 21 April 2022, its decision in Case No. DP-2101-B7725, in which it imposed a fine of SGD 35,000 (approx. â‚¬23,690) to GeniusU Pte. Ltd., for violations of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA').
Background to the decision
In particular, the PDPC noted that it had received, on 12 January 2021, a notification from GeniusU on unauthorised access and exfiltration of a staging application database, affecting the personal data of approximately 1.26 million users. Additionally, the PDPC noted that the datasets affected comprised first as well as last name, email address, and location.
Following investigations, the PDPC detailed that the breach was likely caused by theÂ compromised password of one of GeniusU developers, which allowed the threat actor to enter the GeniusU's environment. Specifically, as GeniusU had stored the login credentials to the database in the codebase in its GitHub environment, the PDPC explained that the threat actor was able to gain access to and exfiltrate personal data stored in the database.
In this regard, the PDPC confirmed thatÂ GeniusUÂ had subsequently requested for the matter to be handled under the PDPC's expedited breach decision procedure. Furthermore, the PDPC also noted that GeniusUÂ had admitted that it was in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.
Findings of the PDPC
Accordingly, the PDPC found that GeniusUÂ breached Section 24 of the PDPA by storing credentials for the database in the codebase in its GitHub environment, meaning that once the threat actor was able to access the GitHub environment, they were able to discover the credentials to access personal data stored in the database. Further to this, the PDPC stated that actual personal data should not be stored in testing environments, which are known to be less secure.
Outcomes
Having consideration for GeniusU's upfront voluntary admission of liability, which significantly reduced the time and resources required for investigations and the prompt remedial actions undertaken, the PDPC imposed a financial penalty of SGD 35,000 (approx. â‚¬23,690). Lastly, the PDPC confirmed that payment is required within 30 days from the date of notice, highlighting that in view of the remedial actions taken, it will not issue any further directions.

SGD 54,000 (approx. â‚¬35,000) for failing to appoint a data protection officer, implement privacy policies and practices, andÂ put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect customers' personal data. In particular, the PDPC found that customers'Â names, dates of birth, passport details, genders and nationalities ('Personal Data Set'), which were stored in Horizon Fast Ferry's internal database for internal use only, were replicated by a contractor hired to revamp the booking site. As a result, whenever a customer entered a passport number on the booking site, the system would auto-retrieve and auto-populate the corresponding Personal Data Set into the booking form.
In addition,Â the PDPC stated thatÂ Horizon Fast Ferry wasÂ in breach ofÂ Sections 11(3), 12Â and 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'), had shown a lack of regard for its data protection obligations, and thatÂ 295,151 customers'Â personal data was exposed to the risk of unauthorised disclosure, among other things.

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') published, on 19 May 2022, its decision in Case No. DP-1912-B5484, as issued on 21 February 2022, in which it imposed a fine of SGD 29,000 (approx. â‚¬19,760) to Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd., which was subsequently reduced to SGD 24,000 (approx. â‚¬16,370), for the violationÂ of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'), following a security incident.
Background to the decision
In particular, the PDPC noted that it had received, on 12 December 2019, a data breach notification from Lovebonito that one of its IT systems had been hacked, resulting in the personal data of 5,561 customers being accessed by a malicious actor.
Following investigations, the PDPC revealed that Lovebonito operated an e-commerce platform and had employed two third-party solutions to manage its website, namely a cloud-based hosting service which included an open-source e-commerce management software and a payment platform used to facilitate credit card payments. As part of this arrangement, the PDPC indicated that the third-party service providers had been collecting customers' credit card information and transferring some of the information to Lovebonito, which was then stored with other customer information that had been collected by Lovebonito for order processing purposes. In this regard, the PDPC found that, at the time of the incident, an administrator account had been compromised, allowing the malicious actor to modify and replace the third-party applications with an unauthorised code, thereby intercepting the collection of credit card information.
Findings of the PDPC
Accordingly, the PDPC concluded that, while Lovebonito did not possess the credit card information collected by the service providers, the company was nevertheless required to implement reasonable security arrangements, since it had control over such information.
As such, the PDPC found that, given the sensitive nature of credit card information, Lovebonito had failed to put in place strong security measures. For example, the PDPC noted that Lovebonito had retained the default settings provided by the service providers and had failed to implement more stringent password policies, such as requiring periodic password changes and reminding employees to refrain from common passwords. In addition, the PDPC determined that Lovebonito had failed to address significant weaknesses within its IT systems, including issues relating to, among other things, unsecured remote access and the lack of adequate security monitoring, filtering, and logging.
Under these circumstances, the PDPC concluded that Lovebonito had breached the 'Protection Obligation' under Section 24 of the PDPA. However, the PDPC also indicated that it had accepted some of the representations made by Lovebonito and acknowledged the sophisticated nature of the attack.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PDPC imposed a reduced financial penalty of SGD 24,000 (approx. â‚¬16,370) on Lovebonito, payable within 30 days from the date of notice. Finally, the PDPC confirmed that, in view of the remedial actions taken by Lovebonito, the PDPC will not issue any further directions.

In particular, the PDPC highlighted that Majestic Debt Recovery had also failed to obtain consent to upload video recordings onto its Facebook page and had not developed the necessary policies and practicesÂ to meet its obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'). As such, the PDPC found that Majestic Debt Recovery had breached Sections 11(3), 12 and 13 of the PDPA and directed it to put in place a programÂ of compulsory training for its employees, as well as develop and implement the necessary policies and practices.

In particular, the PDPC noted that Marshall Cavendish hadÂ suffered a ransomware attack, which affected a learning management system that it was providing for the Ministry of Education ('MoE'). Moreover, the PDPC outlined that although the MoE had found no evidence that personal data in its systems had been taken, personal data had been exposed to unauthorised access, andÂ the affected server held copies of information relating to 206,240 active users and 44,688 inactive users.
In addition, the PDPC highlighted that Marshall Cavendish had implemented remedial measures including, putting in place new security arrangements, conducting a review of existing firewallÂ rules, employing an external auditor, strengthening key programmes, and improving user information management and review systems.

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') published, on 15 September 2022, its decision in Case No. DP-2108-B8814, as issued on 5 August 2022, in which it imposed a fine of SGD 60,000 (approx. â‚¬42,660) on MyRepublic Limited, for a violation of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'), following a security incident.
Background to the decision
In particular, the PDPC recalled that it had received, on 29 August 2021, a notification from MyRepublic that a threat actor had exfiltrated and deleted the personal data of 79,388 customers from the company's IT systems.
In this regard, the PDPC confirmed that MyRepublic had subsequently requested for the matter to be handled under the PDPC's expedited breach decision procedure. As such, the PDPC noted that MyRepublic had voluntarily provided, and unequivocally admitted to,Â the facts of the case, while also admitting to breaching Section 24 of the PDPA.
Findings of the PDPC
Upon investigation, the PDPC noted that, at the time of the incident, MyRepublic had been accepting customer orders for mobile services through its mobile portal, through which customers would submit their identity documents to be stored within the company's cloud storage facility. In this regard, the PDPC found that MyRepublic had failed to implement sufficient processes to manage the access key to the database, as the key was embedded into the portal's source code and thus publicly accessible. Furthermore, the PDPC took the view that MyRepublic had not implemented other reasonable security measures, such as log file redaction, as the key was also clearly captured in logs made available to employees and external developers and engineers.
In determining whether to impose a financial penalty, the PDPC considered the fact that MyRepublic was under a high degree of responsibility, as it had collected a high volume of sensitive data from customers. However, the PDPC accepted certain mitigating factors, including MyRepublic's remedial actions and cooperation during investigations.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PDPC imposed a financial penalty of SGD 60,000 on MyRepublicÂ to be paidÂ within 30 days from the date of notice. Finally, the PDPC confirmed that, in view of the remedial actions taken by the company, the PDPC will not issue any further directions.

Background to the decision
In particular, the PDPC noted that it had initiated an investigation into Nature Society, after receiving reports, on 6 November 2020, that Nature Society's website had been hacked. Following investigations, the PDPC revealed that there had been vulnerabilities in Nature Society's website prior to the incident, resulting in the unauthorised access of the personal data of 5,131 members and non-members.
In this regard, the PDPC confirmed that, in its representations to the PDPC, Nature Society had admitted to breaching the PDPA,Â and had requested for the matter to be dealt with in accordance with the PDPC's expedited decision procedure.
Findings of the PDPC
Accordingly, the PDPC observed that, at the time of the incident, Nature Society had not designated any individual or data protection officer ('DPO') to be responsible for ensuring compliance with the PDPA in accordance with Section 11(3) of the PDPA. Furthermore, the PDPC recalled that Nature Society had not developed or implemented any personal data protection policy, as required by Section 12(a) of the PDPA.
In addition, the PDPC highlighted that Nature Society failed to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data on its website database, pursuant to the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA. More specifically, the PDPC indicated that, after the website had been designed and developed by an external vendor in 2011, Nature Society had not established any contract or retainer agreement with theÂ vendor to maintain the website's security. As a result, the PDPC concluded that the responsibility of protecting its website vested with Nature Society, who ultimately failed to carry out security measures, such as conducting necessary security updates, patches, and penetration tests.
In determining the aforementioned financial penalty, the PDPC considered the following mitigating factors:
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PDPC imposed a financial penalty of SGD 14,000 (approx. â‚¬9,080) on Nature Society, who is required to make the payment within 30 days from the date of notice.

The PDPC outlined that Ncode Consultant had supplied its NITRIX School Management system and acted as a data intermediary to Victoria School, at which time unauthorised logins to the system occurred exposing minors' personal data. The PDPC found Ncode ConsultantÂ in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA as it hadÂ not encrypted or hashed passwords found in the NITRIX system supplied to Victoria SchoolÂ and that the passwords of the systemsÂ were easily decoded with a publicly available online decoder, among other things.

Ltd., for violations of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'), following a data breach notification from the school.
Background to the decision 
In particular, the PDPC noted that it had received, on 2 July 2021, a data breach notification from the school that a parent of a student had been able to view and access a student report throughÂ various search engines. Following its investigation, the PDPC revealed that parents of prospective students had been submitting documents for admission applications via the school's website, which were then stored in a directory that was not adequately secured. As a result, the PDPC found that various documents, including passports, identity cards, digital photographs, and birth certificates, had been at risk of unauthorised access.
In this regard, the PDPC confirmed that the school had subsequently requested for theÂ matter to be handled under the PDPC's expedited breach decision procedure. Furthermore, the PDPC also noted that the school had voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts and had admitted that it was in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.
Findings of the PDPC
Accordingly, the PDPC found that while the school had implemented some mechanisms, the school should have instead implemented properÂ directory permissions and access controls to prevent unintended access by web crawlers. In addition, the PDPC determined that although the school had purportedly relied on a related group company to set up and manage its website, including to make the necessary security arrangements to protect any personal data collected, there were no clear business requirements or contractual stipulations specifying the same.
In these circumstances, the PDPC concluded that the school had breached the 'Protection Obligation' under Section 24 of the PDPA, paying particular attention to the fact that the personal data of minors had been at risk. Nevertheless, the PDPC also considered that the school had ceased the collection of documents via its website, had implemented appropriate Binding Corporate Rules to govern the handling of data protection within its corporate group, and had cooperated with the PDPC's investigations.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PDPC imposed a financial penalty of SGD 10,000 (approx. â‚¬6,540) on the school, who is required to make the payment within 30 days from the date of notice. Finally, the PDPC confirmed that, in view of the remedial actions taken by the school, the PDPC will not issue any further directions.

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') published, on 19 May 2022, its decision in Case No. DP-2002-B5827, as issued on 4 February 2022, in which it imposed a fine of SGD 12,500 (approx. â‚¬8,530) to PINC Interactive Pte. Ltd., for violations of Sections 12(a) and 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'), following a security incident.
Background to the decision
In particular, the PDPC noted that it had received, on 2 February 2022, feedback regarding a Twitter post which revealed that a website managed by PINC had been illegally accessed.
Following investigations, the PDPC found that PINC had created a synthetic database containing both real and fake personal data to be used for staging and development purposes. Furthermore, the PDPC determined that it was likely that such database had been exfiltrated because certain employees had retained a copy of the database on their personal devices, and although those employees had been instructed to use strong passwords, they had been left to manage the security settings on their own computers, where only one antivirus software had been installed. Notably, the PDPC also stated that PINC had implemented access key authentication only and that the incident may have occurred during a period when PINC did not require authentication (i.e. during testing), despite the data being accessible over the internet.
Findings of the PDPC
Accordingly, the PDPC concluded that PINC had failed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data contained in the database. For example, the PDPC noted that PINC had allowed employees to store local copies on their personal devices, without implementing any additional security requirements. In addition, the PDPC indicated that it was unreasonable for PINC to include the personal data of real users within the synthetic database, without processing such personal data before doing so and requiring authentication, noting that organisations should generally only use fake or anonymised data for testing purposes.
Furthermore, the PDPC stated that PINC had failed to put in place any data protection policies or practices for its non-technical employees and that, while some onboarding standards had been given to its technical employees, such rules served to merely facilitate the performance of these employees' core duties.
In these circumstances, the PDPC concluded that PINC had breached the 'Accountability Obligation' and the 'Protection Obligation' under Sections 12(a) and 24 of the PDPA, paying particular attention to PINC's oversight regarding the storage of local copies. Nevertheless, the PDPC also considered that PINC had cooperated with the investigation and had implemented remedial measures to address the incident.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PDPC imposed a financial penalty of SGD 12,500 (approx. â‚¬8,530) on PINC, payable within 30 days from the date of notice. Finally, the PDPC directed PINCÂ to, within 60 days, develop internal data protection policies and to ensure that no local copies of the database are stored on personal devices.Â

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') published, on 14 July 2022, its decision in Case No. DP-2011-B7409/DP-2011-B7421, as issued on 8 February 2022, in which it imposed a fine of SGD 67,000 (approx. â‚¬47,550) on Quoine Pte Ltd, for a violation of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'), following a security incident.
Background to the decision
In particular, the PDPC noted that it had received, on 17 December 2020, a data breach notification from Quoine reportingÂ that the control of its domain hosting account had been transferred to an external actor, allowing them to exfiltrate the personal data of 652,564 customers. Following investigations, the PDPC revealed that, at the time of the incident, an employee had incorrectly transferred control as a result of a social engineering attack.
In this regard, the PDPC confirmed that Quoine had subsequently requested for the matter to be handled under the PDPC's expedited breach decision procedure. As such, the PDPC noted that Quoine had voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts, while also admitting that it was in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.
Findings of the PDPC
Accordingly, the PDPC found that while Quoine had engaged a third-party domain provider to host its domain, the provider did not process any personal data on the company's behalf, nor was it the company's data intermediary. Therefore, the PDPC concluded that the company would be solely responsible for complying with the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA.
More specifically, the PDPC took the view that considering the company's business as a global cryptocurrency exchange that regularly deals with a large volume of sensitive personal data of a financial nature, the company's overall data protection and cybersecurity posture should have been heightened. Notably, the PDPC indicated that the company had failed to review and assess the security implications and risks of its DevOps account and to implement reasonable ICT controls for the same.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PDPC imposed a financial penalty of SGD 67,000 (approx. â‚¬47,550) on Quoine, which is required to make the payment within 30 days from the date of notice. Finally, the PDPC confirmed that, in view of the remedial actions taken by the company, the PDPC will not issue any further directions.

In particular, the PDPC noted SAP Asia had disclosed the payroll information of some of its former employees to the wrong email recipients, as a result of incorrectly executing a payslip program supplied by a third-party vendor.
As such, the PDPC found that SAP Asia had contravened the protection obligation under Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012). More specifically, the PDPC determined that, in procuring the payslip program, SAP Asia had failed to provide accurate specifications to the vendor which reflected the intended use of the program.

In particular, the PDPC highlighted that one of Secur Solutions Group's servers, which contained the personal information,Â had been made publicly available over the internet. Furthermore, the PDPC found that, as a data intermediary of the Health Sciences Authority, Secur Solutions Group is required to comply with Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA') which requires organisations to protect personal information by making reasonable security arrangements. As such, the PDPC found that Secur Solutions Group was in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA but noted that the remedial actions taken by Secur Solutions Group, which include disconnecting the server from the internet and disabling all remote access, had sufficiently addressed the risks to the personal data arising from the incident.

Background to the case
In particular, the PDPC highlighted that on 5 February 2021, Southaven Boutique informed the PDPC of a ransomware attack which occurred on 4 February 2021, in which a third party gained access to the encrypted personal data of 4,709 data subjects, with including names, addresses, email addresses, contact numbers, and dates of birth.
Findings of the PDPC
Notably, the PDPC found that Southaven Boutique did not implement adequate administrative and technical security measures, failing to conduct or schedule any software updates, or security review prior to the incident. In addition, the PDPC outlined that Southaven Boutique had not set out any data protection requirements or responsibilities for the point-of-sale vendor on whom they relied, ensuring the vendor was not aware of its responsibilities and that the system server was not updated.
Accordingly, the PDPC noted that because the statutory obligations of a data controller may not be delegated under the PDPA, Southaven Boutique maintained full responsibility for failing to review or update software and security measures, thereforeÂ violating Article 24 of the PDPA.

Background to the decision
In particular, the PDPC noted that it had received, on 24 February 2021, a data breach notification from the TMCCÂ that an employee's email account had been compromised. Following its investigation, the PDPC revealed that it was likely that a threat actor had used commonly used or default passwords to gain access to the employee's email account, the password of which had not been changed for nearly fiveÂ years at the time of the incident. As a result, the PDPC found that the personal data of 467 individuals had been illegally accessed.
In this regard, the PDPC confirmed that the TMCCÂ had subsequently requested for the matter to be handled under the PDPC's expedited breach decision procedure. Furthermore, the PDPC also noted that the TMCC had voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts and had admitted that it was in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.
Findings of the PDPC
Accordingly, the PDPC found that while the TMCC had implemented some password policies and informed employees of the same via newsletters, the TMCC ultimately failed to further develop its password requirements into a properly documented policy in writing and to disseminate it in a manner whereby all its employees could easily consult the policy at any time. In addition, the PDPC found that the TMCC had not complied with the PDPC's recommendations on ICT best practices and data breaches, nor did the TMCC provide structured training on how to ensure compliance with the obligations under the PDPA.
In these circumstances, the PDPC concluded that the TMCC had breached the 'Protection Obligation' under Section 24 of the PDPA. Nevertheless, the PDPC also considered that the TMCC had engaged an IT forensic vendor following the incident and has since implemented the measures recommended by the vendor to improve its cybersecurity.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PDPC imposed a financial penalty of SGD 4,000 (approx. â‚¬2,620) on the TMCC, who is required to make the payment within 30 days from the date of notice. Finally, the PDPC confirmed that, in view of the remedial actions taken by the TMCC, the PDPC will not issue any further directions.

Background to the decision
In particular, the PDPC noted that it had received, on 11 March 2021, a data breach notification from the Centre that its database servers containing the personal data of 72,285 individuals had been infected with ransomware on 17 February 2021. Following investigations, the PDPC revealed that the Centre had maintained an open and publicly exposed remote desktop protocol port, which allowed the threat actor to compromise administrator account credentials and enter the Centre's network and database, rendering the databases inaccessible. Despite the attack, the PDPC highlighted that the Centre had managed to restore the affected databases, and there was no evidence to suggest that the threat actor exfiltrated the databases.
In this regard, the PDPC confirmed that the Centre had subsequently requested for the matter to be handled under the PDPC's expedited breach decision procedure. Furthermore, the PDPC also noted that the Centre had voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts and had admitted that it was in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.
Findings of the PDPC
Accordingly, the PDPC found that the Centre should have implemented separate access controls (i.e. separate logins) to protect the databases containing personal data, and the number and type of datasets under the Centre's control created a need for stronger access control and added layers of protection.
Furthermore, the PDPC found that the initial unauthorised entry to the Centre's network was through an administrator account that the Centre had assigned to an IT vendor it had engaged to develop and test applications. As such, the PDPC indicated that while the contract with its IT vendor contained a general confidentiality clause, the Centre ultimately failed to stipulate any requirements on the vendor to protect the personal data.
In these circumstances, the PDPC concluded that the Centre had breached the 'Protection Obligation' under Section 24 of the PDPA, paying particular attention to the high number of affected individuals and the nature of the affected data, which included descriptions of medical conditions. Nevertheless, the PDPC also considered that the Centre had voluntarily admitted to its breaches, and there was no evidence of exfiltration of the Centre's databases.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PDPC imposed a financial penalty of SGD 20,000 (approx. â‚¬13,550) on the Centre, which is required to make the payment within 30 days from the date of notice. Finally, the PDPC confirmed that, in view of the remedial actions taken by the Centre, the PDPC will not issue any further directions.

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') announced, on 15 April 2021, that it had fined Tripartite Alliance Ltd SGD 29,000 (approx. â‚¬18,150) for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access of approximately 20,000 individuals' and companies' data stored in the customer relationship management ('CRM') database provided by a software service provider. In particular, the PDPC highlighted that Tripartite Alliance had inadequate processes in place to ensure that their vendor proactively monitored alerts and took actions to block malicious activities in a timely manner, and therefore, was in breach of Article 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'). In determining directions, the PDPC noted that it took into consideration, the high number of affected individuals, the nature of the affected data, Tripartite Alliance's upfront admission of the breach and their prompt remedial actions to mitigate the effects and prevent recurrence of the incident, as well as the fact that there was no evidence of exfiltration of the database in the CRM system.

'''The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') published, on 16 June 2022, its decision in Case No. DP-2013-B8138, in which it imposed a fine of SGD 22,000 (approx. â‚¬15,110) on Vhive Pte Ltd, for a violation of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA'), following a security incident.
Background to the decision
In particular, the PDPC noted that it had received, on 26 March 2021, a data breach notification from Vhive that its customer database had suffered a ransomware attack. Following investigations, the PDPC revealed that, at the time of the incident, the company's IT infrastructure had been outdated, with multiple vulnerabilities, and an unpatched firewall that had allowed the threat actor to remotely execute an unauthorised code on the e-commerce server.
In this regard, the PDPC confirmed that Vhive had subsequently requested for the matter to be handled under the PDPC's expedited breach decision procedure. Furthermore, the PDPC noted that Vhive had voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts, while also admittingÂ that it was in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.
Findings of the PDPC
According to the PDPC, Vhive had admitted that the weakness in its IT infrastructure and its failure to give due attention to the protection of customer data had contributed to the incident. In addition, the PDPC noted that, although the company had engaged an IT vendor to host, manage, and maintain the e-commerce server and all its other IT systems, there was no contract to stipulate clear written security maintenance requirements and data protection requirements to the vendor. More specifically, the PDPC highlighted that the company did not have a security maintenance policy, nor did it conduct any scheduled security reviews.
In reaching its decision, the PDPC considered a number of mitigating factors, including the fact that Vhive had decommissioned its e-commerce webserver and overhauled its IT infrastructure.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PDPC imposed a financial penalty of SGD 22,000 (approx. â‚¬15,110) on Vhive, which is required to make the payment within 30 days from the date of notice. Finally, the PDPC confirmed that, in view of the remedial actions taken by Vhive, the PDPC will not issue any further directions.

Ltd. for its failure to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal dataÂ of its client'sÂ employeesÂ and adhere to data retention requirements. In particular, the PDPC noted that Worksmartly had admitted that it lacked mechanismsÂ to manageÂ the correct security settings on companyÂ internal accounts, which led to employee files being exposed to the public for a period of five days. In addition, the PDPC highlighted that Worksmartly had not conducted the necessary housekeeping and maintenance of files, which resulted in the retention of files for longer than necessary for business or legal purposes.Â Consequently, the PDPC found WorksmartlyÂ had breached SectionsÂ 24 and 25 of Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012), and ordered WorksmartlyÂ to pay the financial penalty within 30 days from the date of this direction.

Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd., respectively, for breaching Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012)Â ('PDPA'). In particular, the PDPC outlined that XDEL inadvertently disclosed the personal data of Zero1's customers, after being contracted by Zero1 to deliver SIM cards. Moreover, the PDPC noted that the protection obligations under the PDPAÂ applied to both XDEL and Zero1,Â and that both organisations had failed to make reasonable security arrangements for the protection of personal data.
Furthermore, the PDPC specified that Zero1 had not made itself adequately aware of XDEL's security processes, and that XDEL had not implemented reasonable arrangements to prevent unauthorised access to its notification webpage system. The PDPC also highlighted that,Â in assessing the penalty,Â itÂ had taken mitigating factors into account,Â including the fact that Zero1 notified the PDPC and data subjects of the breach, and that XDEL had reacted swiftly to rectify the relevant issues.

Park stated, ""The KCC found that Bithumb had failed to implement certain safeguards to protect the personal information of its customers, which resulted in the leakÂ of its customers'Â personal information. The KCC imposed a penalty surcharge of KRW 43.5 million (approx. â‚¬33,850), an administrative fine of KRW 15 million (approx. â‚¬11,700), the recommendation that disciplinary action be taken against the responsible officers or employees, an order that Bithumb immediately discontinue its violations, establish a prevention plan to prevent a similar data breach, and theÂ requirement toÂ announceÂ that itÂ was ordered to take the above corrective measures by the KCC.""
Moreover, Park noted, ""Over the past few years, the need for virtual currency market regulations has become a growing concern for the Government. The KCC's decision to impose sanctions on Bithumb is significant in that it is the first case in which the KCC has sanctioned a Korean virtual currency exchange operator in the absence of any laws directly regulating the virtual currency market. Although there are no laws in South Korea that regulate virtual currency dealers, we believe that, in light of the KCC's decision to fine Bithumb, it is highly likely that regulatory authorities willÂ intensify their crackdown of virtual currency dealers within the scope allowed under the current laws.""

In this regard, the AEPD highlighted that the complainant stated that such processing extended beyond the purpose for which the background check had been intended and was undertaken without their consent.
Findings of the AEPD
Notably, the AEPD foundÂ Alquiler SeguroÂ in violation of Article 6 of the GDPRÂ for failing to respect the principle of lawfulness, which had required proofÂ of legitimate basis for processing the complainant's personal data.
Outcomes
Ultimately, as a result of the infringement, the AEPDÂ imposedÂ a fine of â‚¬70,000 Alquiler Seguro, which was subsequently reduced to â‚¬42,000, upon voluntaryÂ payment by theÂ Alquiler Seguro and its acknowledgement of responsibility,Â thereby terminating the proceedings.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 11 February 2022, its decision in Proceeding No. PS-00267-2020, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬2,000,000 on Amazon Road Transport Spain S.L. for a violation of Articles 6(1) and 10 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and Article 10 of the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December 2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights ('LOPDGDD'), following a request for candidates' criminal records during the hiring process, based on consent.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD outlined that a representative of the General Union of Workers filed a claim with the AEPD, noting that, for the hiring of self-employed contractors, Amazon Road Transport requested certificates of absence of a criminal record, i.e. negative certificates, specifically requiring the consent of the candidates, so that this data can be transferred to group companies and their supplier located outside the European Economic Area.
Additionally, the AEPD noted Amazon Road Transport's claim that, when obtaining a negative certificate, data relating to criminal convictions or offences is not processed, since the certificate does not contain any data relating to the commission of crimes, and as such, do not fall under Article 10 of the GDPR and LOPDGDD, respectively.
Findings of the AEPD
The AEPD rejected the claims of Amazon Road Transport regarding the processing of negative criminal conviction certificates, and refused to accept their interpretation of Article 10 of the GDPR, as well as Article 10 of the LOPDGDD, i.e. that this Article does not relate to criminal records, but rather criminal conviction and offences. As such, the AEPD found that Amazon Road Transport was not diligent, as it failed to implement adequate procedures for the collection and processing of personal data relating to criminal conviction.
Outcomes
As a result, the AEPD imposed the fine of â‚¬2,000,000 on Amazon Road Transport, and ordered the same to cease requiring the certificate of absence of a criminal record from applicants, delete all the information of the certificates already provided, and adapt its processing in accordance to the requirements of ArticleÂ 6(1) of the GDPR, in relation to the Article 10 of the same, and Article 10 of the LOPDGDD. Furthermore, the AEPD declared that Amazon Road Transport had not violated Articles 7 and 49(1) of the GDPR, relating to international data transfers.

In particular, the decision provided that the reason for the claim is that the defendant proceeded to install a dome-type camera on the facade of the property controlling the entrances and exits of the same, registering the images of neighbours as well.

Furthermore, the decision highlighted that the defendant proceeded to pay the fine of â‚¬600 as a result of the discount following anÂ immediate voluntary payment.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 14 January 2022, its decision in proceeding PS/00356/2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬1,500 on an unnamed personÂ for a violation of Article 5(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a claim submitted by a complainant.
Background to the decision 
In particular, the AEPD noted that the complaint filed with the AEPD against the organisation cited the presence of cameras installed by a neighbour close to the complainant's family home, and considered that this may affect their personal or familial privacy, while no clarification was ever received by the AEPD on the installed cameras.
Findings of the AEPD
More specifically, the AEPD found, following a visual inspection, the presence of four security cameras and that the installed sign only specified the installation company. Furthermore the AEPD found that the sign did not denote the person responsible for the cameras, the purposes for their placement, and the area captured by the cameras. Accordingly, the AEPD noted that the cameras, by failing to be oriented towards the owner's private space, and thereby failing to avoid capture of third parties without just cause, were in violation of Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR.
Outcomes 
Finally, the AEPD imposed a fine of â‚¬1,500 on the person, and issued a corrective measure to ensure that within one month from notification of the resolution, the person proves the legality of the camera system and what is captured by them, and certifies a notice indicating the persons responsible forÂ the area that is captured by the cameras.

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted that it had initiated an investigation, following a complaint by a customer of the company who had alleged that the contract was changed without their consent. In addition, the AEPD added that Baser Comercializadora claimed that it had received a call from a woman who claimed to live at the claimant's address and was able to provide details necessary to pass verification, which thereby resulted in the changes to the contract.
Findings of the AEPD
In this regard, the AEPD outlined that Baser Comercializadora violated Article 32 of the GDPR for the lack of adequate security procedures which allowÂ for the proper verification of a customer. Furthermore, the AEPD noted that since Baser Comercializadora's security procedures requireÂ data such asÂ names and surnames, telephone numbers, and addresses, such data may be available to third parties and used for fraudulent purposes. In addition, the AEPD noted that Baser Comercializadora modified the contract without the consent of the claimant, which implies a violation of Article 6 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
As a result of the violation, the AEPD imposed a fine of â‚¬150,000, â‚¬100,000 for the violation of Article 6 of the GDPR and â‚¬50,000 for the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR.

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted that, according to the complainant, theyÂ had received an email from the individual in charge of Bayard's web portal, informing them about the unauthorised access, by a third party, to Bayard'sÂ database containing location and contact details provided by the users through a registration form. Furthermore, the AEPD specified that Bayard assured that it had fixed all the vulnerabilities that made the access possible, implemented security incident protocols, and adopted aÂ series of measures, such as the encryption of the stored information.
Findings of the AEPD
In light of its investigations, the AEPD stated that the users' personal data withinÂ Bayard's database had been unlawfully disclosed to a third party, thus violating the integrity and confidentiality principles under Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR. Additionally, the AEPD specified that Bayard had failed, as the data controller, to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an adequate level of security, breaching Article 32 of the GDPR. Finally, the AEPD found that Bayard violated Article 33 of the GDPR since BayardÂ was aware that it hadÂ suffered a security breach on 28 October 2021 and had not informed the AEPD until 11 November 2021.
Outcomes

('BBVA'), forÂ violations of Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following an individual's complaint.
Background to the decision

Findings of the AEPD

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted that an unknown individual had made a deposit at an ATM of a BBVA branch to pay rent for a flat that the complainant had rented out, following which said individual approached a staff member within the BBVA branch in question as the ATM did not issue any receipt of payment in paper format. Further, the AEPD specified that the staff member had givenÂ the individual a document displaying the complainant's bank account balance. Thereafter, the AEPD explained that, following a written complaint by the complainant on 18 January 2021, BBVA replied, on 10 February 2021, that it had taken the appropriate measures and that those in charge of the affected BBVA branch had apologised.
Findings of the AEPD
In light of its investigations, the AEPD stated that the complainant's personal data stored in BBVA's database had been disclosed to a third party when it should have been deleted or anonymised. Additionally, the AEPD specified that BBVA, as the data controller, had failed to take adequate technical and organisational measures to prevent the disclosure of personal data to unauthorised third parties. Thus, the AEPD found that BBVA violated Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR by breaching the principle of confidentiality, as well as Article 32 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Given the above, the AEPD imposed a fine of â‚¬80,000 for the aforementioned violations. However, the AEPD provided that due to an admission of guilt and a voluntary payment on part of the defendant, the fine was reduced, by 20% respectively, to â‚¬48,000.

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD highlighted that Burwebs is the owner of different internet domains, each containing adult content. Likewise, the AEPD highlighted that personal information must be entered when accessing certain domains.
Findings of the AEPD
Following its investigation, the AEPD outlined that Burwebs actual treatment of personal data did not correspond to the privacy policy provided on the web pages run by Burwebs, and accordingly, Burwebs was found in violation of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR.
Likewise, the AEPD provided that personal data was processed indefinitely, and the indefinite conservation of all personal data of registered users demonstrated a lack of control over users data, thereby Burwebs was found to have violated Articles 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(e) of the GDPR.
Further, the AEPD noted thatÂ although Burwebs claims to not process the personal data, there is evidence of profiles of minors registered as users, and Burwebs did not establish any provision regarding the consent of holders of parental authority or guardianship. Consequently, the AEPD established that Burwebs had violated Article 8 of the GDPR, in relation to the conditions applicable to the consent of minors.
In addition, the AEPD outlined that the procedure for creating an account on Burwebs domains does not verify the identity of the applicant through other information or measures other than those supporting documents initially used. Accordingly, in requiring the provisions of passport or other identification information to exercise data subject rights, Burwebs was found to have violated Article 12(2) of the GDPR.
Moreover, the AEPD noted that Burwebs privacy policy does not inform users of the possibility of revoking consent at any time before the initial provision of consent, alongside a failure to inform users of the period for which their personal data will be retained. Therefore, the AEPD provided that Burwebs violated Article 13 of the GDPR, in failing to comply with the principle of transparency or right to information of the affected party.
Notably, the AEPD also detailed that, with regard to the above violations, Burwebs displayed a total absence of Privacy by Design, and in failing to evaluate the personal data processing cycle, what personal data is to be processed, and what consists of the exact treatment of personal data, thus violatingÂ Article 25 of the GDPR.
Equally, the AEPD established that the record of processing activitiesÂ did not include all the procedures that actually occurred, with there being no record of the retention of unregistered users' data. Resultantly, the AEPD found Burwebs to have violated Article 30(1) of the GDPR.
Finally, the AEPD highlighted that Burwebs provided no information on the use of cookies on its applicable websites, alongside using cookie walls that prevented access to websites and forced users to accept relevant cookies. Therefore, the AEPD held that Burwebs violated Article 22(2) of the LSSI, in failing to provide users with clear and complete information on the use of data storage.
Outcomes
As a result of the aforementioned violations under the GDPR and LSSI, the AEPD imposed fines totalling â‚¬75,000.
Further, the AEPD imposed sanctions, requesting that Burwebs implement corrective measures, within one month of the publication of the decision, and to inform the AEPD of the implemented measures within the same period.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 4 March 2022, its decision in proceeding PS-00226-2020, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬2,100,000 on CaixaBank, S.A. for violations of Articles 6, 6(1), and 7(4) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following complaints from several customers.Â 
Background to the decision
In particular, the complaints concerned customers who, among others, claimed that CaixaBank (previously Bankia S.A.) required them to comply with some conditions in their so-called 'digital profile' for that to be created, which were already pre-ticked. Specifically, the decision outlines that the complainants had to provide their phone number and email address, and grant their consent for the transfer of their personal data,Â for commercial purposes, to third parties,Â including companies of the Bankia Group,Â as well asÂ for the receipt of personalisedÂ commercial communications about products, services, promotions, or discounts. Furthermore, the decision highlights that the pre-contractual information of the customers' 'digital profile' specified that the accountÂ would only be held if all of the above conditions were met, and that customers with this account would be exempted from having to pay a maintenance fee and an administration fee, which should, otherwise, need to be paid by customers not having a 'digital account'.
Findings of the AEPD
Following its investigation, the AEPD found that CaixaBank infringed Article 6 of the GDPR, in connection with Article 7(4) of the GDPR, as it obtained consent for purposes other than those of the agreed contract, conditioning the granting of consent onÂ the exemption from the payment ofÂ the aforementioned fees. Specifically, the AEPD considered that the requirement to give consent for two different processing activities, i.e for the sending of commercial communications and the transfer of personal data to the entities of the Bankia Group, meant that consent was not freely granted.
Additionally, the AEPD found that CaixaBank violated Article 6(1) of the GDPR because it obtained consent through pre-ticked boxes which meant that consent was not free, specific, informed, and unequivocal.
In reaching its decision, the AEPD considered aggravating factors, including the fact that the infringing conduct is the result of CaixaBank's policy to requireÂ consent of its clients for the processing of their personal data by establishingÂ an exemption from the payment of commissions, which affected a large number of interested parties.
Outcomes
As a result, the AEPD imposed the fines of â‚¬2,000,000 and â‚¬100,000 on CaixaBank for violating Articles 6 of the GDPR, in connection with Article 7(4) of the GDPR, and Article 6(1) of the GDPR, respectively.

Moreover, the decision notesÂ that CaixabankÂ responded to the allegations and claimed that it had a legitimate interest in the communications since it was neither personalised commercial communications nor was itÂ directly addressed to the client. Furthermore, the decision discusses whether the cover of the sent envelope can be considered advertising and therefore whether the information sent involved processing of personal data forÂ direct marketing purposes in accordance withÂ Article 4(2) of the GDPR. Nevertheless, the decision concludes that the generic cover of advertisement could be considered advertising, and therefore involving the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD'), published, on 14Â December 2021, its decision in proceeding PS/00178/2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬2,000 to Ceylle Solutions & Development S.L., for violationsÂ of Article 5(1)(f), 32, 39, 83(2), andÂ 83(5) of theÂ EU's General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and Articles 5 and 65(4) of the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December 2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights ('LOPDGDD').
Background to the case
In particular, the decision notes that a complaint was lodged with the AEPD by the claimant,Â on 23 October 2020, stating that the ex-spouse of the claimant hadÂ leakedÂ business information,Â personal information of the claimant himself, and personal information regardingÂ the marital life of the claimant and the respondent, since both were already married and are business partners of Ceylle. Moreover, the AEPD also noted that, on 10 February 2021, the AEPD received evidence that the ex-spouse had sent emails to companies with which the CeylleÂ had a commercial relationship, with the intention, according to the ex-spouse, to prevent the continuation of the business relationship.
Findings of the AEPD
In particular, the AEPDÂ noted that the evidence indicated that the defendant had violated Article 5 of the GDPR and Article 5 of the LOPGDD, namelyÂ principles relating to data processing and the duty of confidentiality, since the claimantÂ revealedÂ information and personal data to third parties. Moreover, the AEPD recalled that the exposure of this personal data by an ex-spouse and business partner, with respect to those whose legitimacy to dispose of them and treat them in the exercise of the rights that may correspond to third parties, implies, in this case, a violation of the principle of confidentiality established by the GDPR in the processing of personal data, a general obligation that is highlighted in Article 5 of the LOPDGDD, without it being understood to be reduced the possibilities and gaps that cause any sort of data leakage.
Furthermore, the AEPD also highlighted that the duty of confidentiality must be respected by the data controllers to prevent transfers of data which have not been consented to by the data subject,Â regardless if it is personal data from customers,Â from the partners ofÂ the Ceylle,Â ex-spouses, or regardless of whether if it is related to the business as a whole or private marital personal data. Therefore, the AEPD determined that this duty of confidentiality is an obligation that is incumbent not only on the responsible and in charge of the data processing, but to everyone who intervenes in any phase of the data processing andÂ  complementary to the duty of professional secrecy.
Outcomes
Based on the findings, the AEPD imposed on Ceylle a fine of â‚¬2,000 for the violation of Article 5 of the GDPR, regarding the abovementioned.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, onÂ 22Â AprilÂ 2022, itsÂ decisionÂ in Proceeding No. PS/00199/2021, in which it imposed aÂ fineÂ of â‚¬7,000Â on an unnamed medical clinic, which was subsequently reduced to â‚¬5,600, for violations ofÂ ArticleÂ 6(1) ofÂ the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), followingÂ aÂ complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the APED noted that theÂ complaint relates to the company's use of the complainant's personal data in the form of photographs of the complainant.Â In this regard, the AEPD stated that the complainant, who had contracted a medical-aesthetic service, had authorised photographs to be taken of the treated area and usedÂ in a documentary, and for educationalÂ andÂ commercialÂ purposes of the clinic concerned. Thereafter, the APED specifiedÂ that the clinicÂ had used the photographs in advertising material, which prompted the complainant to request the removal of their personal data, after whichÂ the sameÂ had appearedÂ on aÂ FacebookÂ account belonging to one of the doctors.
Findings of the AEPD
In light of the above, the AEPD found that the clinic's processing of the complainant's personal data in the form of photographs, and their display on two different channels, the clinic and a Facebook account, took place without a legal basis, amounting to anÂ infringement of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. In this regard, the AEPD specified that Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR confirms that the complainant's consent to the processing of their data must be given 'for one or more specified purposes', and thatÂ the data subjectÂ is entitled to choose whether or not to give consentÂ in respect of each purpose. As such, in this instance, the AEPD noted that the complainant's obtained consent had notÂ encompassed the use of theirÂ personal data and disclosure at the clinic or Facebook for advertising purposes.
Outcomes
Ultimately, as a result of the infringement, the AEPDÂ imposed a fine of â‚¬7,000 on theÂ clinic, which was subsequently reduced to â‚¬5,600, upon voluntaryÂ payment by theÂ clinic,Â thereby terminating the proceedings.

Background to the case
In particular, the decision states that a copy of the minutes of the general meeting held on 3 May 2020, where delivered to a third party, the security company, CMM GuardÂ S.L., contracted by the community owners, which contained personal data of residents of the community. Moreover, the decision confirms that the details of the personal data includes, details regarding the owners with pending receipts, indicating the property name, names and surnames of the owners, amount of debtÂ and actions taken to collect the amounts owed.
Findings of the AEPD
Furthermore, the AEPD noted that the claim was initially against Data 1000 Fincas, in it is capacity as an administrator of the community owners and therefore, in charge of the treatment, in accordance with the instructions received from the person in charge, the community owners. In addition, the APED provided that the Data 1000 Fincas was instructed by the president of the community owners to provide the information in the minutes for the general meeting. Thus, the AEPD confirmed in this situation that the responsible entity is the community owners.

Therefore, the decision informs that CMM Guard could have legitimacy to know the identitfication data and some of the agreements made at the general meeting, however it does not justify the access to information regarding neighbours who owe amounts to the community owners, the debts, nor the personal issues that may be addressed at the general meeting. Further to this, the AEPD emphasised that the community owners should have limited itself to the aformentioned information or should have sent the minutes after having it duly anonymised.Â 
Likewise, the AEPDÂ confirmed thatÂ the delivery of the minutes to the security company, with all the information contained in the minutes, can be understood, without prejudice to what results from the instruction, as a treatment of inadequate personal data, not pertinent and not necessary for the specific purpose of the treatment, contrary to the principles of data protection, specifically, to the principle of data minimisation,Â pursuant toÂ Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 11 May 2022, its Decision in Proceeding No. PS-00523-2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬6,000 on unnamed community owners for the violation of Articles 5(1)(c) and 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD provided that the complainant claimed that, in order to access the swimming pool in their community, they were required to identify themselves through presenting their ID, while their personal data was recorded by the security guard on a paper which could be viewed by anyone and which did not provide any information on how that data would be handled.
Findings of the AEPD
Following investigation, the AEPD found that the community owners breached the data minimisation principle under Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR because they requested an excessive amount of personal data from the claimant beyond the what was the necessary for the purpose pursued, as well as Article 13 of the GDPR because of their failure to inform the users of the community's swimming pool about the intended processing of their personal data upon accessing the swimming pool.
Outcomes
As a result, the AEPD fined â‚¬3,000 for the violation of Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR and â‚¬3,000 for the violation of Article 13 of the GDPR.

In particular, the AEPD noted that the defendant required their clients to provide their personal data to reserve an appointment without informing the data subjects of the legal basis of the processing and the treatment of their personal data. Moreover, the AEPD confirmed that the defendant got rid of the sheets that had the personal data of the data subject by throwing them away, which was considered as a lack of security and privacy measures in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR.
Furthermore, the AEPD emphasised that fining the defendant pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR would constitute a disproportionate burden for the defendant, whose activity principle is not directly linked to the processing of personal data and the fact that the AEPD has not been notified of any previous infringements in terms of data protection by the defendant. Therefore, the AEPD has considered that the corresponding sanction in relation to Article 13 of the GDPR is a direct warning.
Finally, the AEPD applied a reduction to the fine imposed for the voluntary payment of the penalty and the acknowledgment of responsibility, provided that the acknowledgment of the responsibility was made manifest within the period granted to formulate allegations at the opening of the procedure.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 19 November 2021, its decision in proceeding PS/00339/2021, as issued on 19 January 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬1,000 to the Comunidad de Vecinos ('Comunidad 1'), a homeowners association, for violations of ArticleÂ 65.4 of Organic Law No. 3/2018, of 5 December 2018, the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights, and ArticleÂ 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint regarding the installation of video surveillance cameras and where the sign notifying individuals ofÂ video surveillanceÂ didÂ not provide the information on the identity of the data controller orÂ the video surveillance system itself.
Background to the decisionÂ 
In particular, the decision states that the AEPD's investigation followedÂ a complainÂ against Comunidad 1 for failing to provide information on the sign beside the camera, thus disrespecting Article 13 of the GDPR. In light of this, on 4 November 2021, the AEPD verified that no reply hadÂ been received by the AEPDÂ from the data controller, nor any corrective measure hadÂ been adoptedÂ for this purpose.

Findings of the AEPD
The AEPD noted that the camera system was installed in the entrance area of the property with a sign indicating that the area was being monitored; however, the minutes of the homeowners meeting showed that the homeowners had not consented to the installation of the camera system.
In line with this, the AEPD found that Comunidad.1 installed the camera system without proper consent from the rest of the homeowners in violation of Article 6 of the GDPR.

Background to the decision
In particular, the decision notes that an individual filed a complaint with the AEPD against Digital Media Concept after having received aÂ commercial call, despite their telephone number being registered with the Robinson List, which allows people to opt-out from receiving direct marketing communications. Moreover, the decision provides thatÂ in response to the alleged accusation, Digital Media Concept clarifiedÂ that it occurred due to an error and that it was an isolated event that happened only once.
Findings of the AEPD
In its findings, the AEPD emphasised that Article 48(1)(b) of the LGT grants end users the right to oppose receiving unwanted calls for commercial communication purposes and, once such opposition has been exercised and manifested, their data cannot be used for said purpose. In light of these facts, the AEPD found that the individual was proved to have been registered with the Robinson List, thus resulting inÂ Digital Media Concept'sÂ contravention of the provisions of Article 48(1)(b) of the LGT.

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted that the complainant had received 51 emails with medical clearances of unknown individuals from the health insurance company DKV Seguros y Reaseguros, including the individuals' names, surnames, and test data, from 16 April 2020 to 9 March 2021. Further, the AEPD specified that the complainant had repeatedly brought the situation to the attention of DKV Seguros y Reaseguros, whereby the latter did not act until it received notice of the complaint.
Findings of the AEPD
In light of its investigations, the AEPD stated that DKV Seguros y Reaseguros' technical and organisational security measures were not adequate, taking into consideration that the data in question wasÂ of a sensitive nature. Additionally, the AEPD specified that DKV Seguros y Reaseguros had failed to notify the AEPD that it had suffered a personal data security breach, since it had become aware of it on 13 July 2020. Thus, the AEPD found that DKV Seguros y Reaseguros violated Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR by breaching the principle of confidentiality, as well as Articles 32 and 33 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Given the above, the AEPD imposed a fine of â‚¬220,00 for the aforementioned violations. However, the AEPD provided that due to an admission of guilt and a voluntary payment on part of the defendant, the fine was reduced, by 20% respectively, to â‚¬132,000.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 4 May 2021, a decision in proceeding PS/00037/2020, fining EDP Comercializadora SA â‚¬1,500,000 for violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the decision highlights that EDP Comercializadora was fined â‚¬500,000 for an infringement of Article 25 of the GDPR because of the company's failure to implement technical and organisational security measures for the protection of individuals' personal data who entered into a contract of gas services with EDP Comercializadora through various third parties. Specifically, the decision outlines that whereÂ services were contracted through a representative, there was no procedure in place requiring the representative to prove their representation of EDP Comercializadora, which exposed the data subjects to risks, including identify theft, or economic and other damages. Further to this, the decision provides that the data subjects were often asked to give consent to receiving energy-related offers, without proof that the third parties requesting such consentÂ were authorised by EDP Comercializadora for such data processing.
Moreover, the decision highlights that a further fine of â‚¬1,000,000 was imposed on EDP Comercializadora for an infringement of Article 13 of the GDPR, due to its failure to provide sufficient information to the data subjects when contracting through different service providers. Lastly, the decision outlines the factors considered for the imposition of these fines, including the continuing nature of the offences, since these contracting procedures were used since at least 2018 and the high volume of data and processing activities relevant to the proceedings.

In particular, the Decision states that the applicant received an invoice for a gas contract that he had not signed and that EDP Comercializadora claims that the applicant is party to a contract with another energy company that has a supply contract with EDP Comercializadora and therefore the applicant's data was processed on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) (2016/679)Â ('GDPR') asÂ it was necessary for the execution of the contract.
Moreover, the AEPD held thatÂ EDP Comercializadora needed to prove that the applicant had consented toÂ contract with a second entity, and not only its direct energy supplier, and an audiofile containing a conversation on the registration of the applicant in EDP Comercializadora's register was provided by the defendant.Â In addition, the AEPD found that the audio fileÂ however does not explain the origin of the data that EDPÂ Comercializadora tried to link to its register, and did not give the defendant sufficient information about EDP Comercializadora and its status as a contractor, thus leading to a violation of Article 6 of the GDPR.

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted that the complainant, who had an electricity supply contract with EDP Comercial - ComercializaÃ§Ã£o de Energia, S.A.

In this regard, the AEPD explained that the complainant had to re-register with EDP.
Findings of the AEPD
In light of its investigations, the AEPD clarified that the violation must be attributed to Endesa EnergÃ­a, rather than E-Redes. In fact, the AEPD found that Endesa EnergÃ­a violated the principle of accuracy under Article 5(1)(d) of the GDPR, by linking the Universal Supply Point Code, an alphanumeric sequence linked to the electricity or gas supply of each home, to the address of a third party who lived in the same building, but at a different address, and thereafter causing the cancellation of the complainant's electricity supply contract with EDP. More specifically, the AEPD stated that Article 5(1)(d) of the GDPR provides that collected personal data must be accurate and up-to-date, and adequate measures must be taken at all times to ensure its accuracy, taking into account the means available and the purpose for which the personal data is used.

Given the above, the AEPD imposed a fine of â‚¬50,000 on Endesa EnergÃ­a for the aforementioned violation.

Moreover, the decision provides that the information poster of the video-monitored area mentioned the repealed Organic Law 15/1999 of 13 December on the Protection of Personal Data, therefore violating Article 13 of the GDPR. In addition, the decision notes that the customer contracts did not contain any reference to the video surveillance and did not inform the customers how they could exercise their rights pursuant to the provisions of the GDPR.
Furthermore, the decision highlights that the video surveillance systemÂ affected the right to privacy of the customers of the establishment and, therefore violated Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Based on these findings, the AEPD deemed it appropriate to impose a fine of â‚¬2,000 on the defendant for violation of Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR and a further â‚¬1,000 for violation of Article 13 of the GDPR.
In addition, the AEPD ordered the entityÂ to adopt the following measures within 10 business days:

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 9 June 2020, a resolution ('the Resolution') in proceeding No. PS/00417/2019 against Glovoapp23 S.L., fining the company â‚¬25,000 for violating Article 37 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Resolution outlines that two individual complainants claimed that Glovvoapp23Â hadÂ notÂ appointedÂ a data protection officer ('DPO') to whom they could direct their requests. In addition, the Resolution highlights that Glovoapp23 argued that it did not have an obligation to appoint a DPO, since the processing activity carried out was exempted from the obligation provided by Article 37 of theÂ GDPR, andÂ considering that the DPO's tasks were carried out by the company's data protection committee.

On the same, the resolution highlights that the claimant subsequently was contacted by two different companies that presented themselves as Naturgy collaborators. In addition, the resolution notes that the claimant, given the fact that he had problems in relation to the installation of the system with GLP Instalaciones 86, one of the two companies, brought the claim before Naturgy, that confirmed that GLP Instalaciones 86 was not an authorised installer, nor a Naturgy's collaborator. Moreover, the resolution finds that GLP Instalaciones 86's conduct amounted to a violation of the principle of lawfulness of processing, considering that the claimant's name, surname, telephone number, bank account details, and email, among others, were processed without a valid legal basis.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 18 May 2022, its decision in proceeding PS-00140-2020, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬10 million on Google LLC for the violation of Articles 6 and 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following two complaints and subsequent investigation from the AEPD.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AEDP noted thatÂ the complaints concerned the transfer of requests related to the removal of content from Google's various products and platforms, such as the Google search engine and YouTube, to a third party, the 'Lumen Project'. Specifically, the AEPD explainedÂ that to enable the removal of content, Google required users that used the relevant formsÂ to accept the transfer of copies of content removal requests to 'lumendatabase.org', on which they would, subsequently, be published.
Regarding the Lumen Project, theÂ AEDP outlinedÂ that its purpose, as an independent research project, is to study requests for withdrawal or removal of online content made to Internet publishers, search engines, and service providers, facilitate the investigation of its different types, and educate the public, among others. In addition, the AEPDÂ further outlinedÂ that, with respect to the information provided to users about the transfer of personal data to the Lumen Project, the only information offered by Google was a notice inserted in the Google forms themselves, used for the submission of the request, according to which Google does not suppress any information contained in the requests it receives and that, instead, it is the Lumen Project which anonymises the user's contact details.
Findings of the AEPD
Following its investigation, the AEPD rejected the legal basis of 'legitimate interests' claimed by Google, i.e. its contribution to the Lumen Project for purposes of transparency and accountability, as well as to avoid abuse and fraud, finding that users were not duly informed about the legal basis that would justify the transfer of their personal data to the Lumen Project. In this regard, the AEPD determined thatÂ the privacy notice stated that Google does not share information with companies, outside of Google, unless the interested party gives their consent, which contradicted Google's said argument. As such, the AEPD found a violation of Article 6 of the GDPR.Â Lastly, the AEPD found that Google violated Article 17 of the GDPR because the Google forms used did not facilitate the right to eraseÂ users' personal data and did not provide the option to object to such transfer.
In reaching this decision, the AEPD considered, among other things:
Outcomes
Consequently, the AEPD imposed the fines of:
Additionally, the AEPD ordered Google to adopt, within a period of six months from the notification of the decision, the necessary measures to adapt its processing activities to the data protection regulations, and to delete all personal data that have been the subject of a request for the right of erasure communicated to theÂ Lumen Project.

In particular, the decision outlines that Watium SL and Energia y Serivicios ABY 2018, SL filed complaints against I-De regarding the receipt of letters to their clients from I-De without a legal basis for doing so.Â 
Specifically, I-De processed the personal data of clients in order to sendÂ lettersÂ requesting payment of an invoice for third-party access to the network corresponding to the contract and supply point owned by the client,Â adding that non-payment of third party access fees to the network may lead to the suspension of the power supply. To this end, the AEPD highlighted that personal data must only be processed for specific, defined and legitimate purposes, and must not be subsequently processed in a manner inconsistent with such purposes, as part of the purpose limitation principle, and determined that sending informational letters of alleged breaches of contractual agreements to consumers is not compatible with the purposes of collecting the information. As a result, the AEPD noted that I-De may only address end consumers through the intermediary companies, Watium and Energia. In addition, the decision underlined that it is not possible to consider the processing of personal data for such purposes as justified by legitimate interest.
Thus, the AEPD found I-De in violation of Articles 5(1)(b), 5(1)(c) and 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and issued a fine of â‚¬200,000. In calculation of the fine, the AEPD considered, among other things,Â the severity of the offence, the fact that I-De continued to send letters following the filing of complaints regarding the same, and that categories of personal data affected included customer identification data.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 2 FebruaryÂ 2021, a decision in proceedings PS/00335/2020, finingÂ IDFinance Spain, S.L. for a violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the AEPD found thatÂ IDFinance had sent a debt collection email to an individual containing a link to make a payment on the controller's website, through which the individual concerned was able to access the personal data of another customer.
The AEPD therefore concluded that IDFinance had failed to ensure sufficientÂ technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of the third party's personal data. Finally, the AEPD noted that the fine was reduced fromÂ â‚¬5,000 toÂ â‚¬3,000 on account of IDFinance's adknowledgment of the violation and the voluntary nature of the payment.Â

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD stated that on 24 May 2021 the claimant had a telephone conversation with an employee of the defendant, which was recorded without requesting the consent of the claimant in advance.
Findings of the AEPD
Furthermore, the AEPD provided that the defendant recorded the voice of the claimant, without previously informing them or requesting their consent, which violated Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR. Moreover, the AEPD highlighted that the defendant did not respond to the request presented by the AEPD, despite the AEPD having proof of receipt, therefore the defendant did not provide evidence against the claimant.
In these circumstances, the AEPD emphasised that the defendant is reminded that recording the voice of clients without prior notice and without their consent violates the right to privacy of third parties, and in the event of non-cooperation with the AEPD, this may be consideredÂ a hindering attitude, which may contribute to the imposition of an economicÂ sanction.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 1 July 2021, a decision in proceedings PS/00205/2021, fining an individual â‚¬6,000 for unlawfully processing personal data pursuant to Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the decision highlights that it initiated investigative actions when it became aware of the dissemination of a video through Twitter, in whichÂ images of aggressive behaviour of a man towards a woman were shown which could constitute a crime of gender violence. Furthermore, the decisionÂ emphasises that the video also showed images of a minor who intervened and tried to avoid the aggression that was taking place.
Moreover, the decision notes that in certain frames of the video the child and his mother could be identified and a precautionary measure is issued to remove the tweets and the withdrawal was requested through the established web form. However, the decision providesÂ that Twitter, in a letter sent to the AEPD, appeared to have shared the video in the aim to raise awareness about the violence perpetrated against women and that, since they serve the public, they share information that constitutesÂ a public interest, aligning the shared tweets with the mission of the social network.
Additionally, the decision states that the original penalty wasÂ â‚¬10,000 which was reduced toÂ â‚¬6,000 because of the individual'sÂ immediate payment and acknowledgement of responsibility.Â

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 23 June 2021, its decision in proceeding PS/00151/2021, fining Marbella Resorts SL â‚¬7,000, for failing to comply with Article 28(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and infringing of Article 22(2) of the Law of Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce ('LSSI'). Â 
In particular, the decision outlines that the Marbella Resorts' violation of Article 22(2) of the LSSI was regarding the cookie policy banner on its website.

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted that the complainant, following an accident in a Mercadona branch, had exercised their right of access to the images of security cameras, via Mercadona's website, with the purpose of claiming damages, for which the complainant did not receive a response. Moreover, the AEPD stated that, after a month of no response, the complainant had contacted Mercadona's data protection officer ('DPO'), who replied by denying receipt of the request for access and informing the claimant that the requested images in question had been deleted. Further, the AEPD also added that the complainant had filed a complaint with Mercadona itself, via its website, about the accident that had occurred.
Findings of the AEPD
In light of its investigations, the AEPD stated that the lack of attention to the right of access exercised by the complainant was in breach of Article 12 of the GDPR. Furthermore, and concurrently to the said violation, the AEPD added that the fact that proof of damage concerning the accident may be found in the images captured by the security cameras prevails over the obligation to delete the images within a maximum period of one month from when they were captured. In this regard, the AEPD specified that the processing of personal data, through the deletion of such images, without a legal basis violates Article 6 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Given the above, the AEPD imposed a fine of â‚¬170,000 on Mercadona for the aforementioned violations and ordered them to adopt adequate measures to comply with data protection law within one month from the notification of the decision.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 27 July 2021, its decision in proceeding PS/00120/2021, fining Mercadona, S.A. â‚¬2,520,000, following the conclusion of the AEPD's investigation into the use of facial recognition systems carried out in Mercadona's establishments for the purpose of detecting the individuals with criminal convictionsÂ or restraining orders. In particular, the decision highlights, among other things, that the processing of biometric data through the facial recognition systemÂ did not only occur in relation to the identification of individuals with convictions or criminal offences, but rather affectedÂ any customer who walkedÂ into the supermarkets, including children, as well as Mercadona's employees.Â 
Furthermore, the decision finds that the processing of personal data through facial recognition systemsÂ by MercadonaÂ does not fall under the exceptions of the general prohibition of processing special category data under Articles 9(2)(f) and 9(2)(g) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').Â Consequently, the decision concludes that the processing of personal data was not legitimate based on the criteria under Article 6 of the GDPR, and was alsoÂ contrary to the principles of necessity, proportionality, as well as data minimisation pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR. Moreover, the decision outlines that the Data Protection Impact Assessment carried out by Mercadona was incorrect, in the sense that it did not take into account the specific and unique risks for Mercadona employees posed by the data processing through facial recognition systems. In addition, the decision outlines that Mercadona's data processingÂ violated the transparency requirements under Articles 12 andÂ 13 of the GDPR and the principle of Data Protection by Design under Article 25(1) of the GDPR.

In particular, the decision notes that the entity failed to respond to a request for information within the term granted, ten business days, from the AEPD.
Furthermore, the decision considers that, amongst others, the sanction imposed should be based on the aggravated factor that the company is not newly created and should have procedures established for the fulfillment of the obligations contemplated in the regulations of data protection, including to respond to the requirements of the authority of control.

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD initiated a sanctioning procedure against MyHeritage, following a complaint by the Organisation of Consumers and Users ('OCU') which indicated a series of potential breaches of data protection regulations by MyHeritage, who are responsible forÂ offering genealogical services, including DNA analysis and comparisons. The complaint was subsequently forwarded to MyHeritage, and following lack of response, the AEPD decided, on 30 November 2020, to process said claim.
Findings of the AEPD
After assessing MyHeritage's practices with regards to the potential breaches indicated by OCU, the AEPD found that there have been deficiencies regarding the website's cookie policy, including the fact that the website uses non-necessary cookies, does not provide the possibility of rejecting cookies, and the cookie policy does not identify the cookies used, hence breaching Article 22.2 of the LSSI.
Additionally, the AEPD found that MyHeritage omitted two pieces of information in its privacy policy; i.e. the possibility of exercising the right to data portability and the right to file a claim with the supervisory authority, which resulted in a violation of Article 13 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
As a result of the cookie violation, the AEPD fined MyHeritage â‚¬20,000, which was subsequently reduced to â‚¬16,000 following use of two reductions for the voluntary payment of the fine, and imposed a warning for the infringement of Article 13 of the GDPR.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 1 February 2022, its decision in Proceeding No. PS/00046/2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬70,000 on Orange EspaÃ±a Virtual, S.L. for the violationÂ of Article 5(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016679) ('GDPR'), following the failure to implement appropriate security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personal data.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted it received two complaints from Orange EspaÃ±a's customers, which referred to alleged criminal acts by fraudulent parties, consisting of duplicating and activating the SIM cards, taking control of the telephone lines, and subsequently enabling them to carry out fraudulent banking transactions that the customers had not authorised.
Findings of the AEPD
Following its investigations, the AEPD found that Orange EspaÃ±a had not properly checked the identity of the fraudsters before issuing the SIM cards. Furthermore, the AEPD provided that the measures implemented by Orange EspaÃ±a were insufficient because it enabled the personal data to be transferred to the fraudulent third party.
Moreover, the AEPD confirmed that the data processed to issue a duplicate SIM card and the SIM card that explicitly identifies the subscriber on the network, are defined as personal data, and therefore their treatment must be subject to the GDPR.
In addition, the AEPD consideredÂ that it is more than proven that the practice of the above isÂ fraud andÂ that this is a frequent practice and so, therefore, operators must have appropriate measures that guarantee that a SIM card is not unduly provided to those who are not the rightful owner. Hence, from the analysis of the documentation, the AEPD concludedÂ that the measures adopted by Orange EspaÃ±a have not been adequate for this purpose.
Further, in finding the offence to be very serious in nature, the AEPD considered, among other things, that the sanction imposed should be based on the following aggravating factors:
Moreover, the AEPD considered the following mitigating factors, to be taken into consideration:
In these circumstances, the decision emphasises that the fine must be dissuasive, so that the offending conduct is not repeated in the future.
Outcomes
As a result of the above, the AEPD imposed a fine of â‚¬70,000 on Orange EspaÃ±a for violation of Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR pursuant to the principle of integrity and confidentiality.

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted that it had received a complaint regarding the alleged lack of security measures for the server that hosted the information system of the SPC. More specifically, the AEPD clarified that the complaint followed a cyberattack by an anonymous group of hackers, on 23 October 2013, which accessed and disseminated the personal data of the SPC's members.
Findings of the AEPD
In light of its investigations, the AEPD argued that the SPC failed to comply with the principle of security, in accordance with Article 9 of the LOPDGDD, with regard to the personal data contained in its files, which enabled an unauthorised third party to access it. In this regard, the AEPD specified that the unauthorised access to the database was not only the result of a cyberattack, but rather a case of failing to implement adequate security measures and to establish the mechanisms that would have prevented that access in the first place.
Outcomes
Given the above, the AEPD imposed a fine of â‚¬40,001 on the SPC for the aforementioned violation.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 16 November 2020, a resolution in proceeding PS/00274/2020, fining Raise Marketing S.L. â‚¬1,500 for receiving unwanted commercial calls from Factor EnergÃ­a, SA despite the claimant being registered in the Robinson List which excluded the sending of commercial communications. In particular, the resolution highlights that Raise Marketing failed to meet its obligations under the agency contract withÂ Factor EnergÃ­a, SA, as it had not used an updated version of the Robinson List relying instead on a different database obtained from the public domain.Â Furthermore, the resolution finds that, in accordance with Article 33(2) of the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December 2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights ('LOPDGDD'), Raise Marketing, which was in charge of the marketing callsÂ and which, based on a clause in the agency contract, had to identify themselves as the issuer of the calls, rather than FactorÂ EnergÃ­a. Therefore, Raise MarketingÂ appeared to be the data controller since it hadÂ processed the claimant's data for its own purposes, thereby violating Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') relating to the right of objectionÂ to direct marketing.

Background to the case
In particular, the AEPD highlighted that it had received a notification of a possible breach of the GDPR, such that the AEPD sent a request for information to Ramona Films both through email and later by post, where Ramona Films was notified of the obligation to interact electronically with the AEPD. However, the AEPD outlined that despite confirmation of receipt of the notification, Ramona Films did not send any response to the AEPD.
Findings of the AEPD
In its findings, the AEPD outlined that Ramona Films failed to provide the information requested by the AEPD,Â violating Article 58(1) of the GDPR, regardingÂ the failure to enable the AEPD to obtain access to all personal data and information necessary for the performance of its investigative duties.
Outcomes 
Based on the aggravating factors, the AEPD deemed it appropriate to impose a penalty of â‚¬30,000 on Ramona Films for the aforementioned violations.

Background to the resolution
In particular, the AEPD noted that it had initiated an investigation into a website owned by Ramona FilmsÂ concerning the processing of personal data of minors under the age of 14 and the associated profiling of these minors.Â 
Findings of the AEPD
The AEPDÂ found thatÂ Ramona Films had violatedÂ Article 13 of the GDPR, in that it had failed to adequately provide informationÂ to data subjects as required. In addition, Ramona Films had violatedÂ Article 22(2) ofÂ the LSSI, in that the website did not have an adequate cookies policy.Â

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 28 December 2021, its decision in proceeding PS/00493/2020, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬6,000 to Real Club Nautico de Ribadeo, for violationÂ of Article 6(1)Â of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD reported that the complaint concerned the publication, on the website and Facebook page of the Club, of the links to two court judgments, containing the personal data of the complainant and of other data subjects, in relation to a civil court proceeding involving the complainant and the Club, concerningÂ the management of the latter. In addition, the AEPD noted that it had invited the Club to provide its comments on the facts in question, following which the Club had notified the removal of the aforementioned links. At the same time, the Club had also noted that the publication of saidÂ linksÂ was however based on the Club's legitimate interest in publicly reporting serious acts committed against the Club, and added that the news of the civil court proceeding had also been reported by some local newspapers, in which the identiy of the complainant was clearly reported. Nevertheless, the AEPD highlighted that according to the complainant, the page on the Club's website containing one of the links remained available through a Google search.
Findings of the AEPD
Moreover, the AEPD determined that the complaint in question involved two opposing fundamental rights, i.e. the fundamental right to the protection of personal data of the persons whose data appeared in the judgments, mainly the complainant, and the fundamental right to freedom of information of the Club. Further to this, the AEDP, in conducting a balancing of interests test, considered, among other things, that the complainant did not cover a public role, that the proceeding in question was a civil rather than criminal matter, and that the details concerning the civil court proceeding were only relevant for the members of the Club, without having any public relevance.
As such, the AEPD held that the data processing in question could not be based on the Club's legitimate interest and thus violated Article 6(1)Â of the GDPR.
Outcome
In concluding, the AEPD issued the aforementioned fine, indicating that the decision may be suspended in case of appeal by the Club before the judicial authority.

In particular, the Resolution outlines that the form submitted by Real Sporting de GijÃ³n to members of the clubÂ did not comply with the applicable legislation, since consent did not consist in an affirmative action, and was therefore ambiguous. In fact, the Resolution highlights that the form aimed to collectÂ data subjects' consent through their inaction, since they had to tick the relevant boxes in order to deny their consent to the sending of commercial communications. Moreover, the Resolution found that Real Sporting de GijÃ³n's conduct amounted to a violation of Article 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').

More specifically, the AEPD stated that Servicios Especiales had communicated to CGT that the complainant's previous appointment as workers' representative at the Unitary Trade Union of Huelvas might be incompatible with the complainant's appointment at CGT. Finally, the AEPD clarified that Servicios Especiales had also provided details of their dismissal at the Unitary Trade Union of Huelvas, their name, and information on their trade union membership to several media outlets.

Moreover, the decision provides that the claimant later tried to apply for a customer card from Servicios Financieros Carrefour, however they were denied and provided with the information that Servicios Financieros Carrefour had a corresponding marking for the ID card number, and therefore the claimants debts were still active.
Findings of the AEPD
Following its investigations, the AEPD found that Servicios Financieros Carrefour's conduct in consulting the credit default record in order to assess the solvency of the claimant without subsequently informing him was without legal basis, in breach of Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR.

In particular, the decision notes that a workers' union lodged a complaint with the AEPD against the entity that had implemented a biometric identification system to control workers' access using their fingerprint, a system that was used along with a card reader system. Moreover, the decision highlights that biometric systems are very intrusive to data subjects' rights and freedoms, that they are generally prohibited, and that restrictions shall be interpreted restrictively. Furthermore, the decision emphasises that before implementing such a system, the controller should have carried out a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA'), to determine whether an alternative less intrusive method was possible in order to attain the same results.

Following its investigation, the AEPD outlined that Techpump Solutions' actual treatment of personal data did not correspond to the privacy policy provided on the web pages run by Techpump Solutions, with transfers of personal data to companies within the same group occurring, despite the privacy policies claim that such a process will not occur. Therefore, the AEPD provided that Techpump Solutions violated Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR.
Likewise, the AEPD provided that Techpump Solutions indefinitely maintained the personal data of those who used the relevant webpages, until website users requested the withdrawal of consent. Consequently, the AEPD noted that Techpump Solutions, in failing to establish the scope or purpose of data processing, violated Article 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(e) of the GDPR.
In addition, the AEPD clarified that the ability of Techpump Solutions to acquire personal data from users without having previously obtained their consent for processing, through a clear and voluntary affirmative act, constituted an infringement of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.
Furthermore, the AEPD provided that Techmpump Solutions' webpages displayed an absence of conditions requiring the consent of holders of parental authority or guardianship, in order for minors under the age of 14 to access relevant webpages. Accordingly, the AEPD found Techpump Solutions to have violated Article 8 of the GDPR, owing to the absence of such mechanisms to ensure a parent's or guardian's consent.
Equally, the AEPD found that although the majority of Techpump Solutions reside outside Spain, the information in its privacy policy was in English, a non-official language in Spain. Therefore, the AEPD detailedÂ that, in failing to provide information on its processing activities in a intelligible, clear, and simpleÂ manner, in such a way that it is understandable by the target audience, Techpump Solutions violated Article 12(1) of the GDPR.
Similarly, the AEPD specified that the requirement to provide personal information, including passport information, to exercise data subject rights, represented a violation of Article 12(2) of the GDPR by Techpump Solutions, regardless of potential doubts as to the identity of the data subject.
Further, the AEPD noted that the information provided in Techpump Solutions privacy policy did not correspond to the actual treatment of personal information, failing to allow interested parties to know how their personal information is processed, thereby violating Article 13 of the GDPR.
More in detail, the AEPD established that Techpump Solutions began to process personal data of users directly, without stopping to evaluate the cycle of processing of personal data, and what personal data should be processed. Thereby, the AEPD held that, in failing to take into account the principles of Article 5 of the GDPR, Techpump Solutions violated Article 25 of the GDPR.
On the GDPR, the AEPD finally provided that Techpump Solutions often collected personal information, including IP addresses, without explaining to the usersÂ what the applicable circumstances are, despite the privacy policy contradicting the processing reality. Consequently, the AEPD found that TechpumpÂ Solutions violated Article 30(1) of the GDPR, in failing to provide an accurate description of the categories of personal data processed.
Finally, the AEPD highlighted that Techpump Solutions provided no information on the use of cookies on its applicable websites, alongside using cookie walls that prevented access to websites and forced users to accept relevant cookies. Therefore, the AEPD held that TechpumpÂ Solutions violated Article 22(2) of the LSSI, in failing to provide users with clear and complete information on the use of data storage.
Outcomes 
As a result of the aforementioned violations under the GDPR and LSSI, the AEPD imposed fines totalling â‚¬525,000.
Further, the AEPD imposed sanctions, requesting that Techpump Solutions implementÂ corrective measures, within one month of the publication of the decision, and to inform the AEPD of the implemented measures within the same period.

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted that four customers had lodged complaints with the AEPDÂ against TelefÃ³nica after being victims of fraud. Moreover, the AEPD provided that fraudsters obtained a replica of the data subjects' SIM cards through TelefÃ³nica, and consequently carried out various bank transfers from online banking services and concluded contracts at the expense of those affected.
Findings of the AEPD
Following its investigations, the AEPD found that TelefÃ³nica had not properly checked the identity of the fraudsters before issuing the SIM cards. Furthermore, the AEPD highlighted that TelefÃ³nica was unable to prove that they had verified the identity of the requester of the replication, the invoices issued, or the effectiveness of the measures implemented to prevent identity theft.
Moreover, the AEPD noted that the facts constitute a violation of Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR, asÂ thatÂ TelefÃ³nica had duplicatedÂ SIM cards and provided them to third parties who wereÂ not the legitimate owners of the mobile lines. In addition, the AEPD detailed that TelefÃ³nica allowed third parties to modify the ownership of the contracted servicesÂ after the fraudsters were able toÂ overcome the security policies implemented by the operator, which evidences a breach of the duty to protect customer information.
Furthermore, in deciding that the proportionality of the fine was proportionate, the AEPD considered, amongÂ other things, that the sanction imposed should be based on the following aggravatingÂ factors:

Furthermore, the AEPD provided that the personal data of the claimant was incorporated into the information systems of the company, without having proven that it had a legal basis for the collection and further processing of the personal data, and therefore they were processing personal data without any legal authorisation.

E.F.C.Â â‚¬15,000, then reduced to â‚¬9,000 for the recognition of responsibility to the allegationsÂ and voluntary payment, for violation of Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the unlawful processing of the complainant's personal data in the course of business activities.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD stated that the complainant was initially informed by UniÃ³nÂ FinancieraÂ that data processing operations were cancelled and then blocked. The AEPD noted that following this, UniÃ³nÂ FinancieraÂ did not verify the cancellation of data processing, indicating to the claimant that the data was blocked without notifying them of the treatment being carried out, and later claiming thatÂ there had been no intention by the claimant to request for the deletion of the personal data, leading the claimant to raise a complaint with the AEPD.
Findings of the AEPD
Ultimately, the AEPD found that UniÃ³nÂ Financiera had wrongfully processed the claimant's personal data since they were already blocking it, thus processing the personal data of the complainant without a legal basis in violation of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Notably,Â the AEPD consideredÂ the intentionality or negligence in the infringement of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, since UniÃ³nÂ Financiera consulted the data of the claimant despite being blocked, as an aggravating factor in relation to the â‚¬15,000 fine.

Background to the decisionÂ 
In particular, the decision states that the complainant alleged thatÂ three of theÂ defendant's websites had been in violation of provisions of the GDPR as the companyÂ failed to provide any information regardingÂ theÂ identity of the controller. More specifically, the decision notes that one of the company's websites redirects users to a page that allows them to enter and submit their personal data in a form, without requiring acceptance of the privacy policy or a link directing to the same. Furthermore, the decision stated that no informationÂ as toÂ the identity of the controller of the website was to be found on the privacy policy accessible through the homepage, or anywhere else on the website.Â 
Findings of the AEPDÂ 
Notably, the AEPD found that the company, by collecting personal data from website usersÂ without previously obtaining free and informed consent, had been in breach of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the AEPDÂ also foundÂ that the company was in breach of Article 13 of the GDPR for collecting the personal data of website users without providing the necessary informationÂ aboutÂ itsÂ data processing activities, particularly its identity as controller of the website.Â

Furthermore, the AEPD specifiedÂ that on the website, personal data could be obtained through a 'purchase form'.
Findings of the AEPD
Notably, the AEPD found the defendant in breach of Article 6(1) of the GDPR for processing personal data unlawfully in connection with the purchase form on its website, as it had failed to obtainÂ website users' consent prior to processing their personal data. Additionally, the AEPD found the defendant in breach of Article 13 of the GDPR for failure to put in place a privacy policy on its website.Â Furthermore, the AEPD noted that there was no mechanism on the website that allowed users to reject cookies that are not technical or necessary nor a cookie policy informingÂ users of the necessary characteristics of the cookies used. As such, the AEPD also found the defendant in breachÂ of Article 22(2) of the LSSI.Â 
Outcomes

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted that, according to the complainant, the companyÂ had recorded via CCTV, together with video footage, the audio of a private conversation of the complainant. In particular, the complainant alleged that the recording of sounds had not occurred based on a lawful basisÂ for processing personal data.
Findings of the AEPD
In light of its investigations, the AEPD stated that both images and voices captured by a video camera system are personal data and, as such, their processing is subject to data protection regulations. Additionally, the AEPD explained that the company had not properly informed the complainant in advance of the fact that the video surveillance system would also record sounds, and that, because the company was not able to provide valid justification for the need to record audio in addition to video footage, such recording did notÂ have any appropriate lawful basis for being processed. Thus, the AEPD specified that the company had unlawfully processed personal data without a legal basis, breaching Article 6 of the GDPR.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 1 February 2022, its decision in Proceeding No. PS/00001/2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬3.94 million on Vodafone EspaÃ±a, S.A.U., violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 5(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016679) ('GDPR') for not implementing appropriate security measures to prevent fraudulent replication of SIM cards, and not being able to prove that Vodafone implemented such measures.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD noted that nine customers lodged complaints with the AEPD against Vodafone after being victims of fraud, due to the deceitful use of their SIM cards. Moreover, the AEPD provided that fraudsters obtained a replica of the data subjects' SIM cards through Vodafone, and consequently carried out various bank transfers from online banking services and concluded contracts at the expense of those affected.
Findings of the AEPD
Following its investigations, the AEPD found that Vodafone had not properly checked the identity of the fraudsters before issuing the SIM cards. Furthermore, the AEPD highlighted that Vodafone was unable to prove that they had verified the identity of the requester of the replication, the invoices issued, or the effectiveness of the measures implemented to prevent identity theft.
Moreover, the AEPD remarked that Vodafone's security measures were insufficient, as any person who had the basic personal data of a data subject could avoid Vodafone's security policy in this regard, and obtain a replica of the data subject's SIM card, without any supplementary requirements. Therefore, the AEPD concluded that Vodafone showed a lack of accountability, breaching Article 5(2) of the GDPR, for a lack of proper analysis, planning, implementation, maintenance, control, and updating of the security measures. Further to this, the AEPD noted that this related to Data Protection by Design, as enshrined in Article 25 of the GDPR.
In addition, the AEPD found that Vodafone violated Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR as it did not act with enough diligence to prevent the circumvention of their security measures against the theft of identity. In relation to this, the AEPD informed that Vodafone should have known the risk as the measures in place were clearly insufficient andÂ inadequate.
Further to the above, the AEPD mentioned that although Vodafone arguedÂ that the duplicate of SIM cards occurred as a result of human error, the AEPD noted that continuous human errors is a deeper problem within the organisation, which demonstrates a lack of foresight of the risks, a lack of analysis and planning,Â and a lack of security measures.
As a result, the AEPD informed that the affected data subjects had also lost their power to arrange and control their personal data, as a SIM card allows the access to apps and services that require authentication or password retrieval via SMS, therefore enabling identity theft for the majority of web services such as email, online banking, social networks, etc.
In deciding the sanctioning, the AEPD decided to fine Vodafone â‚¬3.94 million for violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 5(2) of the GDPR. Further, in deciding that the fine was proportionate, the AEPD considered, amongÂ other things, that the sanction imposed should be based on the following aggravatingÂ factors:

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') announced, on 3 November 2020, its decision, in proceeding PS / 00341/2020, to fine Vodafone EspaÃ±a, S.A.U. â‚¬30,000 in relation to a claim that Vodafone had processed the claimant's personal data for a service contract with a third party without the claimant's consent and failed to take necessary precautions to verifyÂ the authenticity of the third party in question. In particular, the AEPD outlined the absence of due diligence byÂ Vodafone, the fact that essential personal information had been affected, and the involvement of processing of client and third-party personal data in Vodafone's business activities as key factors in its decision to fine Vodafone. The fine was subsequently reduced to â‚¬30,000 as a result of Vodafone's voluntary payment.Â Â

In addition, the decision noted that the lack of diligence displayed by VodafoneÂ in complying with the obligations imposed by the personal data protection regulations is, therefore, evident and that diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the processing of third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in a position to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).Â

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 23 November 2021, its decision in proceeding PS-00280-2021, as issued on 4 October 2021, in which it fined Vodafone EspaÃ±a, S.A.U. â‚¬50,000, then reduced to â‚¬40,000 for voluntary payment, for a violation of Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the unlawfulÂ processing of the complainant's personal data in the course of its business activities.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD stated that the complainant was initially informed by Vodafone of a number of contracted services associated to his ID which he had not recognised. The AEPD noted that following this, the complainant filed a claim with the Secretary of State for Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructures ('SETID') for Vodafone having opened a line under his ID without his consent, a claim which was later rejected by SETID as the complainant was informed there were no active services under his ID, which later promoted the complainant to raise a claim with the AEPD.
Findings of the AEPD
Ultimately, the AEPD found that Vodafone had wrongfully associated the complainant's personal data to another customer's account, thus processing the personal data of the complainant without a legal basis in violation of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.
Outcomes
Notably, the AEPD in imposing the â‚¬50,000 fine considered the following as aggravating factors in relation to imposing a sanction:

Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD outlined that it had received a complaint, on 28 October 2020, from an individual complaining that they had requested from Vodafone a copy of their telephone contract on several occasions without ever receiving it. Furthermore, the AEPD noted that the complainant alleged that they had eventually received from Vodafone an e-mail with the telephone contract of another customer.
Findings of the AEPD
In light of its investigation, the AEPD held that the above facts constituted an unlawful disclosure of the personal data of another Vodafone customer to the complainant, who therefore had access to the name, ID number, and telephone number of an unknown person without any prior authorisation from them. In this regard, the AEPD considered that the known facts constituted a violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR, as well as an infringement of the requirement to implement technical and organisational measures to secure the processing of personal data under Article 32 of the GDPR.
Outcomes
In view of the above, the AEPD decided to impose a fine of â‚¬70,000 on Vodafone, comprised of a penalty of â‚¬50,000 for the violation of Article 5(1)(f) and â‚¬20,000 for the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 28 January 2022, its decision in proceeding No.Â PS/00557/2021, as issued on 29 November 2021, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬56,000 to Vodafone EspaÃ±a, S.A.U., for violation of Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the unauthorised processing of personal data.
Background to the decision 
In particular, the AEPD noted that on 10 September 2020 the claimant agreed to port their mobile number to Vodafone, but on the 14 September 2020 cancelled the new contract, which prompted the salesperson who initially discussed the contract and whoÂ belonged to an agency Vodafone used, to call and berate the claimant on different phone numbers, and later berate the claimant's daughter on a third phone number. Furthermore, the AEPD outlined that, on 3 November 2021, Vodafone outlined that the phone numbers used by the agency which called the claimant were assigned to Vodafone's collection service, correspondedÂ to Vodafone's collection service, and wereÂ not assigned to any customer of Vodafone. Moreover, the AEPD provided that they did not have any registered information regarding the daughter of the claimant, and were not aware of the relationship between the two.
Findings of the AEPD
Furthermore, the AEPD found that the documentation provided by Vodafone highlighted that the agents of Vodafone continued to process the personal data of the complainant after cancellingÂ porting the claimant's personal data. Accordingly, the AEPD noted Vodafone violated Article 6(1) of the GDPR, for trying to process personal without the legitimacy to do so.
Outcomes 
Based on these findings, the AEPD deemed it appropriate to impose on Vodafone a fine of â‚¬56,000 for violation of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, which may be reduced to â‚¬42,000 on voluntary payment of the penalty, and acknowledgement of responsibility.

'''The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 17 May 2022, its decision in Proceeding No. PS/00111/2022, in which it imposed a fine of â‚¬70,000, which was subsequently reduced to â‚¬42,000, to Vodafone EspaÃ±a, S.A.U., for the violation of Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following the receipt of a complaint submitted by an individual.
Background to the decision
In particular, the AEPD outlined that, according to the complaint, Vodafone EspaÃ±a had sent multiple invoices to the complainant, notwithstandingÂ the fact that it had previously confirmed that the complainant had no outstanding debts and that it had proceeded with the deletion of their personal data.
Findings of the AEPD
Further to this, the AEPD foundÂ that, due to a malfunction in the systems, the deletion of the complainant's personal data had not been completed correctly, resulting in additional invoices being issued to the same. Based on established facts, the AEPD found that Vodafone EspaÃ±a had violated Article 6(1) of the GDPR, since it had processed the personal data of the complainant after it had confirmed the deletion of the same, thereby processing personal dataÂ in the absence of a legal basis.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the AEPD imposed the aforementioned fine, which, due to an admission of guilt and a voluntary payment on the part of Vodafone EspaÃ±a, was reduced to â‚¬42,000.

Background to the decision

Moreover, Datainspektionen criticisedÂ Google for not havingÂ removed two of the search results, as instructedÂ in 2017. Specifically, Google was criticised for havingÂ made too narrow an assessment of which URLs ought to actually be removed from search results, and, on another occasion,Â hadÂ not removed a search result in a timely manner. Furthermore, Datainspektionen held that when Google removes a search result listing andÂ notifies the website ownerÂ of which webpage link was removedÂ and who was behind the delisting request, it was in fact doing so without a legal basis, and, therefore, Datainspektionen ordered Google to cease and desist from that practice.Â

Furthermore, the Datainspektionen noted that the High School Board had also violated Article 35 and 36 of the GDPR for failure to complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') and for failure to consult with the Datainspektionen prior to the processing of personal data.Â 
The High School Board argued that it had received express consent to the use of facial recognition technology from the pupils' guardians, but the Datainspektionen noted that this was incorrect because, due to the unequal nature of the relationship between the High School Board and its pupils in the context of verifying attendance, consentÂ could not be freely given. Morevover, the Datainspektionen stated that, when determining the amount of the fine, it had notedÂ that it considered the High School Board violation ofÂ Articles 5 and 9 to beÂ serious and therefore subject to a higher fine. In addition, the Datainspektionen outlined that the High School Board's processing of children's sensitive personal data and the fact that it had processed such data intentionally wereÂ aggravating factors, butÂ the limited time period and the limited number of pupils affected wereÂ mitigating circumstances when calculating the amount of the fine.Â

'''The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection ('IMY') published, on 16 March 2022, its Decision No. DI-2020-5868, as issued on 14 March 2022, in which it imposed a fine of SEK 300,000 (approx. â‚¬ 29,020) to the Swedish Customs, for violations of Chapter 3, Articles 2 and 8 of the Criminal Data Act (SFS 2018:1177), following investigation into a personal data breach at the Swedish Customs.
Background to the decision 
In particular, the IMY stated that it had completed an investigation of a personal data breach at the Swedish Customs, noting that a few employees carrying out the Swedish Customs' law enforcement activities have used the cloud service Google Photo in their staff mobile phones, linking their private Google Photo accounts to their mobile phones, which automatically synced the photos and videos taken in their official duty to the cloud service. However, the IMY stated that the Swedish Customs had stated that the use of Google Photos was not permitted within the authority.
Findings of the Ombudsman 
In particular, the IMY stated that there must be clear routines and guidelines for employees' use of company mobiles and that employees also need to receive training and information on how personal data may be processed on the mobile phones. However, the IMY noted that there are also mitigating circumstances, including the fact that there have only been a few employees who have used the cloud service without the authority's approval. Furthermore, the IMY stated that images and movies uploaded to the cloud service have been deleted. Moreover, the IMY outlined that after the incident was discovered, the Swedish Customs has taken both technical and organisational measures to prevent similar incidents, among other things, by clarifying guidelines and limiting the possibilities of downloading applications.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the IMY imposed a fine of SEK 300,000 (approx. â‚¬ 29,020) against the Swedish Customs, noting that this is a considerably lower amount than what would have been justified without the mitigating circumstances. Furthermore, the IMY noted that the Swedish Customs may appeal the decision to the IMY, noting that it must receive the appeal no later than three weeks from the date of the decision was notified.

'''The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection ('IMY') published, on 27 January 2022, its decision in DI-2021-5595, as issued on 26 January 2022, in which it imposed a fine of SEK 1.6 million (approx. â‚¬154,150) to the Uppsala Hospital Board, for violations of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following an investigation.
Background to the decision 
In particular, the IMY stated that it had initiated an inspection against the Region due to its notification on 7 May 2019 of a personal data incident. In addition, the IMY noted that its audit covered the personal data processing carried out by the Uppsala Hospital Board in connection with the sending of emails containing patient data by the Uppsala University Hospital to patients and referrers in third countries, and the storage of patient data in the Outlook email hosting service. Moreover, the IMY outlined that it examined whether the personal data processing complies with the security requirements laid down in Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the GDPR.
Findings of the IMY
In particular, the IMY noted that the Uppsala Hospital Board had, as a controller, during the period from 25 May 2018 to 7 May 2019, processed personal data and thereby breached of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the GDPR, as the Uppsala Hospital Board had sent large amounts of patient data through unencrypted emails over an open network to patients and referrers and had stored patient data in Outlook. In addition, the IMY found that the processing was also in violation of the Region's own guidelines, meaning that the Uppsala Hospital Board had not taken appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in relation to the risk of the processing.
In addition, the IMY noted that the processing by email and storage constituted linked processing operations within the meaning of Article 83(3) of the GDPR, because the processing operations concerned the processing of the same personal data in Outlook and related to the infringement of the same provisions. Furthermore, the IMY outlined that the aggravating factorsÂ included, among others, the fact that the processing operations had been going on for a long time and the Uppsala Hospital Board had not taken prompt action to protect the personal data despite being aware of the security breaches, the processing had been carried out systematically and had involved a large amount of health data, which was sent unencrypted over an open network and stored in Outlook. However, the IMY noted that the mitigating factors included the fact that the Uppsala Hospital Board had introduced technical measures in the form of an encryption solution for files in September 2019.
Outcomes
As a result, the IMY fined the Uppsala Hospital Board SEK 1.6 million (approx. â‚¬154,150) for violations of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the GDPR. In addition, the IMY stated that theÂ Uppsala Hospital Board can lodge an appeal no later than three weeks from the date the decision was notified.

'''The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection ('IMY') published, on 27 January 2022, its decision in DI-2019-9457, as issued on 26 January 2022, in which it imposed a fine of SEK 300,000 (approx. â‚¬28,910) to the Regional Board ofÂ Uppsala ('the Uppsala Regional Board'), for violations of Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following an investigation.
Background to the decision 
In particular, the IMY stated that its audit covered two categories of personal data processing operations, with the first category relating to emails containing patient data that were sent automatically to the relevant healthcare administrations within the Region for purposes including administration and quality assurance, and the second category relating to emails containing patient data that were sent manually to researchers and doctors within the Region for purposes, such as research and quality monitoring. In addition, the IMY noted that it examined whether the personal data processing operations in the emails complied with the security requirements set out in Article 32 of the GDPR.
Findings of the IMY
In particular, the IMY noted that the Uppsala Regional Board had, as a controller, during the period from 25 May 2018 to 7 May 2019, processed personal data and thereby violated Article 32(1) of the GDPR, as it had sent excel files containing sensitive personal data and personal identification numbers by email. In addition, the IMY found that with respect to the first category of personal data processing, approximately 25 emails were sent automatically each month, and for the second category approximately 200 to 250 emails were sent manually per year. Furthermore, the IMY noted that, though the transmission of the email was encrypted, the information contained in the excel file was not. Moreover, the IMY found that the processing was also in violation of the Region's own guidelines, meaning that the Uppsala Regional Board had not taken appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in relation to the risk of the processing.
In addition, the IMY noted that the manual and automatic transmission of emails constituted linked processing operations within the meaning of Article 83(3) of the GDPR, because the processing operations concerned patient data which were retrieved from the main medical record system, Cosmic, for similar purposes, such as administration and quality assurance. Furthermore, the IMY outlined that the aggravating factors included, among others, the fact that the processing operations had been going on for a long time, had been carried out systematically, and had involved a large amount of health data which could have been accessed by unauthorised individuals after the transfer. However, the IMY noted that the mitigating factors included the fact that the transmission of the email had been encrypted and that the email had been sent internally within the Region, and the Uppsala Regional Board had stopped the processing operations when it had notified the personal data breach to the IMY on 7 May 2019.
Outcomes
As a result, the IMY fined the Uppsala Regional Board SEK 300,000Â (approx. â‚¬28,910) for violations of Article 32(1) of the GDPR. In addition, the IMY stated that theÂ Uppsala Regional Board can lodge anÂ appealÂ no later than three weeks from the date the decision was notified.

In particular, the decision notes thatÂ Voice Integrate Nordic AB had violated Article 32(1) of theÂ General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') by failing to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an adequate level of security in that a server operated by the company had not been adequately protected and was accesible to the public.Â

'''The Swedish Post and Telecom Authority ('PTS') published, on 18 January 2022, its decision in Dnr: 21â€“10499, as issued on 18 January 2022, in which it imposed an injunction and a fine of SEK 5,000,000 (approx. â‚¬482,625)
Background to the decision 
In particular, the PTS stated that in case of suspicion of Internet-related crimes, the Police Authority must be able to request subscription information from the broadband operator that provides the current IP address in order to be able to identify a person. In addition, the PTS noted that in one case, the Police Authority had approached Bahnhof and, pursuant to Chapter 6, Section 22(2) of the Electronic Communication Act, requested information about the identity of a person behind an IP address. Furthermore, the PTS stated that the Police Authority had provided Bahnhof with the public IP address as a basis, but not the port number, since the Police Authority did not have access to it. However, the PTS noted that Bahnhof had refused the Police Authority's request, and as a result the Police Authority had complained to the PTS.
Findings of the PTS
In particular, the PTS stated that Bahnhof and other broadband operators that use the address translation technology NAT, are required to store other information, in addition to the IP address, so that it is possible to identify an individual subscriber if one only has information about the IP address. Furthermore, the PTS noted thatÂ even following its request for information, notification, and a clarifying question from PTS, Bahnhof hadÂ not responded to whether it will disclose subscription data pursuant to Chapter 6, Section 22(2) of the Electronic Communication Act in the absence of a port number. Hence, the PTS stated that Bahnhof must be ordered to ensure that the information on subscriptions regarding suspected crimes, requested by the Police Authority, is disclosed even if there is no information about the port number.
Furthermore, the PTS stated that in its opinion, these circumstances taken together indicate that Bahnhof will not take corrective action unless the injunction is accompanied by a penalty payment. Moreover, the PTS stated that Bahnhof is deemed to have the actual and legal opportunity to comply with the injunction within the specified time limit and the injunction should therefore be combined with a penalty payment. Moreover, the PTS considered that in view of Bahnhof's financial situation and other circumstances, the amount of the fine should be set at SEK 5,000,000 (approx. â‚¬482,625).
Outcomes
In light of the above, the PTS ordered Bahnhof to ensure that the information on subscriptions relating to suspected crimes, requested by the Police Authority or another authority, is disclosed even if the request does not contain the port number. Furthermore, the PTS decided that Bahnhof has two weeks to change its routines and disclose information about subscriptions to the Police Authority, hence the deadline for rectification is 1 February 2022. Lastly, the PTS noted that Bahnhof has three weeks to appeal the decision.

'''Under the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (as amended in 2015) ('PDPA'), there is no single central government agency that is in charge of enforcing the PDPA. The regulatory agency in charge of each industry has the authority and power to enforce the PDPA, stipulate related requirements, and issue rulings on such matters specific to that industry. The Ministry of Justice ('MoJ') used to serve as an internal coordinator among government agencies to interpret the general rules under the PDPA. In July 2018, the NDC assumed such role of the MoJ and became responsible for obtaining the GDPR adequacy decision for Taiwan. The first submission was filed with the EU in December 2018. Thereafter, the NDC's special taskforce has been in regular communication with the EU either in meetings or conference calls. The first round of the Taiwan-EU consultation was completed in 2019 and the second round of consultation was expected to take place in 2020 with the aim to receive the adequacy decision in the same year. However, the relevant plans and schedules were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
For obtaining the adequacy decision, the NDC started the relevant work and drafting amendments to the PDPA in the second half of 2019. The proposed amendments were originally scheduled to be published for public comments in the middle of 2020 but the plan was postponed and the proposed amendments have not been published by the NDC thus far. In the meantime, certain legislators submitted several proposals at the Legislative Yuan to amend the PDPA but none of the draft bills have passed the legislative's review thus far.
Recently, the Taiwan Government resumed the relevant tasks to obtain the adequacy decision and took a series of actions. In December 2020, the Executive Yuan convened a meeting of regulatory agencies and government authorities for the establishment of an internal coordination taskforce ('the Collaborative Meeting') to coordinate the efforts of such agencies and authorities with regard to personal data security matters, for example, notification of data breach incidents. According to the Collaborative Meeting's resolution, dated 3 February 2021, to ensure a consistent process and timeline for reporting data breach incidents, the Executive Yuan requires regulatory agencies and government authorities to amend the respective personal data file security plans that they promulgated for their specific industry ('Data Security Regulations'), explicitly requiring each private sector to: (i) report data breach incidents to the competent authorities within 72 hours; and (ii) adopt specific security measures if a business requires and adopts IT to operate its business, for example, e-commerce businesses.
On 6 August 2020, the Executive Yuan convened another meeting of regulatory agencies and government authorities to discuss the restrictions on cross-border personal data transfers and instructed them to further amend their respective Data Security Regulations to require each private sector to check, before conducting any cross-border personal data transfer, if the Taiwan Government has issued any orders or rulings banning or restricting cross-border personal data transfers and to notify the data subjects of additional information with regard to cross-border personal data transfers. It is uncertain as to whether the Taiwan Government will issue further orders or rulings to ban or restrict cross-border personal data transfers. It is also worth monitoring how each regulatory agency will amend its Data Security Regulations.
According to the Open Government Agenda, adopted by the Taiwan Government, the NDC is considering amending the PDPA to: (i) include the right to object set forth under the GDPR; (ii) grant data subjects the right to request their digital footprints; (iii) introduce specific rules for data controllers to inform data subjects of any use beyond the specified purpose(s) of collection and of any decision made automatically via machine by using open data; (iv) further set forth detailed rules with regard to the notification obligations to data subjects in the event of a data breach; (v) allow data subjects to withdraw consent; and (vi) require data controllers to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment, etc. In 2019, the NDC also contemplated amending the PDPA to: (i) adopt a cross-border data transfer mechanism similar to that under the GDPR; and (ii) specifically set forth that the PDPA shall have an extra-territorial effect regulating foreign data controllers or processors similar to what GDPR does.
It is anticipated that more regulations and rulings on personal data security will be issued by the end of 2021 and that the NDC will soon hold a public consultation on the proposed amendments to the PDPA.

'''The Personal Data Protection Authority ('KVKK') published, on 27 December 2021, a summary of its decision in case No. 2021/993, as issued on 30 September 2021, in which it imposed a fine of an unspecified amount to an unnamed cargo company, for violations of Articles 12(1)(a) of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data No. 6698, following an invoice being inadvertently sent on behalf of the complainant by the data controller.
Background to the case
In particular, the KVKK highlighted that the complainant claimed that the cargo company sent an invoice to a professional organisation, but the invoice was made on the behalf of the data subject and included personal information such as email address, TR ID number, etc.
Findings of the KVKK
More specifically, the KVKK found that although normally cargo companies may lawfully provide the personal data of the data subject, it was unlawful to process personal data by issuing invoices on behalf of the data subject without any reason for compliance with Article 12(1)(a) of the Law. In addition, the KVKK highlighted that the cargo company had not taken the necessary technical and administrative measures to ensure the appropriate level of security in order to prevent the illegal processing of personal data within the framework of the Law. Moreover, the KVKK noted that as the data controller is required to keep the personal data for certain periods in accordance with the relevant legislation, there is no illegality in not fulfilling the data subject's request for the deletion of their personal data.
Outcomes
Following its investigation, the KVKK outlined that the cargo companyÂ had not taken the necessary technical and administrative measures to ensure the appropriate level of security, and in accordance with Article 18(1)(b) of the Law administrative fines will be imposed.

Background to the case
In particular, the KVKK highlighted that despite the complainant having no relationship with the digital platform, the complainant frequently received calls and marketing attemptsÂ to get them to join the digital platform. More specifically, the KVKK noted that the complainant is not in any way a customer of the digital platform dealer and their affiliation with the company is undeterminable. In addition, the KVKK detailed that the complainant is not registered as a potential customer,Â and therefore, it is unknown where and how the personal data of the complainant was obtained. However, the KVKK outlined that digital platform dealers can create potential customers by accessing the digital platforms customer relationship management ('CRM') systems with the username and password provided to them.
Findings of the KVKK 
More specifically, the KVKK found that although the dealership of the digital platform may be defined in the contract as a data processor, and the digital platform as a data controller, in the circumstances, the dealership of the digital platform wasÂ a data controller since the digital platform itself wasÂ defined as a customer in the central CRM system, in accordance with Article 3 of the Law. Furthermore, the KVKK noted in the circumstances that as the dealership of the digital platform wasÂ a data controller, the digital platform dealership processed the personal data by calling the phone number of the complainant without consent, and thusÂ violated Articles 5(1) and (2) of the Law.
Outcomes 
Following its investigation, the KVKK outlined that the digital platform dealership had not taken any of the administrative measures provided under Article 12(1) of the Law, and administrative fines will be imposed as a result.

'''The Personal Data Protection Authority ('KVKK') published, on 17 December 2021, a summary of its decision in case No. 2021/32, dated 12 January 2021, in which it imposed a fine of an unspecified amount and criminal sentencing on an unnamed bank, for violations of Article 12 of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data No. 6698 ('the Law'), following a complaint received from a data subject regarding appropriate administrative and technical measures.
Background to the case
In particular, the KVKK highlighted that the data subjects' personal information was revealed during their divorce proceedings in court, andÂ included information regarding their financial history.Â Furthermore, this informationÂ was submitted to the court by the bank without the data subject's approval or permission.
Findings of the KVKK
More specifically, the KVKK found that although the bank noted that it had taken technical and administrative measures regarding theÂ appropriate level of securityÂ for personal data, no substantiating documents were given to the KVKK regarding these measures. Accordingly, the KVKK detailed that although the bank was aware of its breach under the Law, the absence of adequate measures and a notification of the breach ensured that the bank was in violation of Article 12 of the Law.
Outcomes 
Following its investigation, the KVKK outlined that because of the bank's absence of administrative and technical measures provided under Article 12 of the Law, an administrative fine mayÂ be imposed on the bank. Furthermore, the KVKK detailed that crimes provided for under Article 136 of the Turkish Penal Code No. 5237 may have been committed, and the matter has been reported to the Office of Chief Public Prosecutor for the necessary legal proceedings.

'''The Turkish data protection authority ('KVKK') published, on 3Â SeptemberÂ 2020, its decisionÂ of 22Â JulyÂ 2020, fining a data controller TRY 900,000Â (approx. â‚¬101,840) for violations related to the transfer of personal data usingÂ the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data ('Convention 108') as the basis for transfers. In particular, the decision outlines thatÂ the data controller failed to comply with Article 9 of theÂ Law on Protection of Personal Data No. 6698 ('the Law'), which requires that data controllers obtain the explicit consent of the data subject prior to a data transfer unless the transfer falls under one of the exceptions permitted under the Law. Moreover, the data controller sought to rely on the exception provided for by Article 9(2)(a) of the Law, which permits data transfers without explicit consent ifÂ the receiving country provides sufficient protection.Â 
The KVKK has yet toÂ publishÂ a list of countries deemed to provide sufficient protection, howeverÂ the controller sought to rely on the fact that the receiving country was party to Convention 108 and therefore offered sufficient protection. The KVKK outlined that the fact that a receiving country is a party to Convention 108, although a contributing factor in the assessment of an adequate level of protection,Â is inÂ itself an insufficient measure in determining adequacy.

Background to the decision
In summary, the decision notes that the human resources company sent the complainant commercial emails, without having any previous legal relationship with the complainant. Moreover, the decision provides that the company did not provide the complainant any information regarding how and where they obtained the complainants personal data. Furthermore, the decision provides that the company did not request the complainant's consent to process their personal data nor did they comply with their request for the deletion of theirÂ personal data. Further to the investigation, the company noted that the email address of the complainant was obtained within the scope ofÂ economic activities (survey and promotion works) carried out by the company.
Findings of the KVKK
In its findings, the KVKK highlighted that the company did not provide explanations regarding how the personal data of the complainant was obtained and under which condition under the Law did it process the data. Therefore, the KVKK outlined that, since the email address of the data subject was processed by sending a commercial email to the data subject, and none of the processing conditions under Article 5 of the Law were complied with, the KVKK decided that the obligation to 'prevent the unlawful processing of personal data'Â within the framework of Article 12(1) of the Law was violated.

Background to the case
In particular, the KVKK were able to identify the telephone lines specified in the claim and the relevant persons were found to be M.D and M.A. Moreover, the KVKK outlined that the complainant had received calls to his mobile number from three different telephone lines owned by M.D on different dates to inform him about the Digiturk digital platform, Krea Content Services, and ProdÃ¼ksiyon Anonim Åžirketi, (owned by beIN MEDIA GROUP) services. In addition, the KVVK noted that an SMS had been sent by M.A regarding the aforementioned services to the complainant by another telephone line, without any explicit consent. Following the defence received by Krea Content Services, it was noted that the dealership had contracted out the operator service M.D. Furthermore, the KVKK emphasised that M.A, in his defence, noted that the advertisement was sent to the complainant once a voluntary form was filed by the complainant on a website.
Findings of the KVKK
Following the investigation, the KVKK noted that it couldn't determine that Krea Content Services acted as a data controller pursuant to a subcontract with M.D. Moreover, the KVKK emphasised that M.D had the title of data controller and had the authority to determine the persons to be contacted and had access to the telephone number of the complainant. Furthermore, the KVKK determined that M.A. acted as a data controller, as he created his own database, processed the personal data of the complainant, and sent the commercial SMS to the complainant.
In addition, the KVKK confirmed that on the form that was provided by M.A the 'I give consent' box was ticked and was signed by M.A himself with the name and telephone number of M.A, which provides insufficient information to confirm that the form was filled by the complainant, therefore the form was not considered as an express, lawful consent.
Moreover, the KVKK stated that since it could not be determined that Krea Content Services acted as a data controller no action is to be taken against them within the scope of Article 12 of the Law.
In conclusion, the KVKK considered that the processing of the telephone numbers by both M.D and M.A was not based on any processing condition set out in Article 5 of the Law, therefore the KVKK imposed an administrative fine within the scope of Article 12(2)(b) of the Law.
Outcomes
With respect to the violation of Article 12 of the Law, the KVKK imposed an administrative fine on the data controllers M.A and M.D in accordance with Article 18(1)(b) of the Law.

Background to the decision
In summary, the complainant submitted a complaint to the KVKK, stating that a law firm acting on behalf of the creditor, on various dates, sent messages to the complainant regarding enforcement proceedings to which the complainant was not a party. Moreover, the KVKK noted that neither the law firm nor the creditor responded to the complaint application that was submitted by the complainant within the legal period.
Findings of the KVKK
In its findings, the KVKK highlighted that the data controller who decides the purposes and means of data processing activities is the lawyer acting on behalf of the law firm, rather than the creditor company. Moreover, the KVKK noted that the lawyer's processing of personal data of debtors without explicit consent in order to fulfil their legal obligations is lawful.
Furthermore, the KVKK emphasised that according to the Trade Registry Gazette provided to the KVKK, the complainant was a partner of the debtor company, however upon further investigation, it was found that the termination of the partnership was also published on the Trade Registry Gazette.
In additionÂ to this, the KVKK considered to not impose any sanctions on the debtor company that is not a data controller. However, the KVKK decided to impose an administrative fine against the lawyer acting on behalf of the law firm for processing the telephone number of the complainant by sending messages regarding the enforcement proceedings of the creditor, which the complainant has no interest in, and which was considered to not be based on any of the processing conditions listed in Article 5 of the Law.

Findings of the KVKK
In its findings, the KVKK highlighted that the fact that the photograph of the persons concerned was published by blurring by the media company does not remove the personal data quality of the said photograph, since it is possible to identify the persons concerned when the blurred photograph and other information such as 'name and surname' are combined/matched.

'''The Personal Data Protection Authority ('KVKK') published, on 17 December 2021, a summary of its decision in case No. 2021/78, as issued on 3 February 2021, in which it imposed a fine of an unspecified amount and criminal sentencing to a data controllerÂ providing telecommunications services, for violations of Articles 12(3) and (5) of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data No. 6698 ('the Law'), following a notice sent to the KVKK regarding a complainant's passport photos.
Background to the case
In particular, the KVKK highlighted that an employee working for the data controller, without the complainant's consent, stored the complainant's passport photos in a WhatsApp group created by employees of the data controller, which was also shared with third parties. However, the KVKK noted that the data controller provided documents regarding training in the protection of personal data, which wasÂ given to employees, and that the employees were only permitted to use company computers, with theÂ use of personal phones within the storeÂ prohibited.
Findings of the KVKK
More specifically, the KVKK found that the illegal behaviour of the employee, regarding the storage of complainants' passport photos, was detected on camera by the data controller, thereby constituting a data breach. Further, the KVKK detailed that the data controller,Â in failing to notify the KVKK of such a breach, violated Article 12(5) of the Law. In addition, the KVKK provided that the data controller, in failing to carry out necessary audits to ensure the implementation of the Law, also violated Article 12(3) of the Law.
Outcomes 
Following its investigation, the KVKK outlined that the data controllerÂ had not taken the appropriate security measures provided under Article 12 of the Law, and administrative fines under Article 18 of the Law, will be imposed as a result. Furthermore, the KVKK noted that the criminal sentencing will be imposed for the employee of the data controller,Â in accordance with Article 136 of the Turkish Penal Code No. 5237.

'''The Personal Data Protection AuthorityÂ ('KVKK') published, on 29 March 2021, a summary of its decision, dated 3 February 2021, fining a telephone operator TL 125,000 (approx. â‚¬13,000) for unlawful processing of contact data for SMS marketing purposes. More specifically, the phone numbers of a hospital's patients had been sent a fixed telephone operator, pursuant to an agreement between the hospital and the operator, with the operator subsequently using the patients' numbers for SMS marketing purposes. Further to its investigation, the KVKK found that the telephone operator used the patients' numbers for the creation of its own marketing database regardless of whether the patients had given their consent to SMS marketing. Therefore, the KVKK decided that, while the agreement between the hospital and the telephone operator was a controller-processor agreement, the operator creating its own database meant that they were a data controller. On the basis of the above, the KVKK considered that the processing of the patients' data for SMS marketing was unlawful, as well as that the operator had failed to take adequate technical and organisational security measures.

In particular, the KVKK confirmed that the violation occurred as a result of a data breach notification where user names and passwords were obtained from other websitesÂ by malicious users in the 'member login' tab ofÂ the website of the data controller, resulting in unauthorised access to the accounts of 29 customers. Moreover, the KVKK noted that personal data affected by the breach includes names, surnames, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, registered addresses, and product information previously purchased in the customers transaction record.
Furthermore, the KVKK highlighted that on the retailers website, member entries are not protected by two-factor authentication, members are not forced to log in with a strong password, and the web application firewall is not effective enough.
Finally, the decision confirmed that although the obligation of the data controller in 72 hours was not fulfilled, it was decided that the 1-day delay was reasonable due to the pandemic.

'''The Personal Data Protection Authority ('KVKK') issued, on 10 March 2022, its decision in Decision No. 2022/229, in which it ordered a fine of TRY 100,000 (approx. â‚¬45,980) to an unnamed company, for the violations of Articles 5, 6, 9, and 12(1) of the Law on Protection of Personal Data No. 6698 ('the Law'), following a complaint.
Background to the decision
In particular, the KVKK stated that the complaint concerned the unlawful processing of personal data by the data controller operating in the e-commerce sector through cookies used on the website/mobile application.
Findings of the KVKK 
In particular, the KVKK held that, while consent is not needed with respect to strictly necessary cookies for a website to function properly, consent is needed when using cookies for advertising, marketing, and performance purposes. In addition, the KVKK stated that, although Article 5(2)(f) of the Law is provided as the basis of the data processing activity carried out by the data controller through cookies, it is not possible to rely on this legal basis in terms of the processing performed through cookies that are not strictly necessary cookies, and instead, the consent of the user should be sought. Furthermore, the KVKK held that the processing activity is carried out by the data controller without relying on any of the conditions specified in Articles 5 and 6 of the Law, and personal data is transferred without relying on any of the transfer procedures set out in Article 9 of the Law, noting that these constitute a violation ofÂ Article 12(1) of the Law.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the KVKK imposed a fine of TRY 100,000 (approx. â‚¬45,980) for failing to fulfil the obligation to take the necessary technical and organisational measures to ensure data security within the framework of Article 12(1) of the Law.

In particular, the KVKK outlined that Whatsapp had previously updated its terms of service and privacy policy,Â requestingÂ that Turkish users of the app accept the new terms of service in order to continue using the service and that it had launched an 
In addition, the KVKK noted that following its investigation it had found that despite Whatsapp stating that its processing was based on a number of different legal bases and that explicit consent was only used in exceptional cases, the investigation found thatÂ because the terms of service are defined as an agreement that is entered into with the user by requesting the approval of the user to the Terms of Service, this means that data controllers relyÂ on the explicit consent obtained through the terms.Â Moreover, the KVKK concluded that when considering that a single explicit consent was taken from users for a number of purposes including transfer to third parties and that no other options were provided and thatÂ these purposes had beenÂ combined in the Terms of Service, the free will element required for valid consent had been damaged.Â 
Furthermore, the KVKK noted that the terms of 'transfer'Â in the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are presented by the data controller in a non-negotiable manner and thatÂ data subjects are forced to give consent to the contract as a whole which resulted in transfers of data to third parties being a precondition to use of the service violatingÂ the 'lawfulness and fairness'Â principle as set out by Article 4 of the Law.Â

'''The Personal Data Protection Authority ('KVKK') published, on 7 February 2022, a summary of its decision in Decision No.Â 2021/1324, as issued on 23 December 2021, in which it imposed a fine of TRY 1.9 million (approx. â‚¬122,130) to Yemek Sepeti Elektronik Ä°letiÅŸim Perakende Gida Lojistik A.Åž., for violations of Article 12(1)(a) of the Law on Protection of Personal Data No. 6698 ('the Law'), following a data breach within the company's web application server.
Background to the decision
In particular, the KVKK noted that Yemek Sepeti notified the KVKK of a data breach on 18 March 2021, noting that a web application server belonging to Yemek Sepeti was accessed by an unidentified person(s). Moreover, the decision provides that in a normal condition, in case of an unauthorised access, a tool that is being used by Yemek Sepeti would have alerted and recorded the unauthorised access, however, in this situation the unauthorised access could not be noticed at that moment due to a malfunction.
Furthermore, the decision provides that when the alarms were received and examined on 25 March 2021, a suspicious behaviour was identified. Further to the investigation, the decision notes that it was determined that an application was installed by taking advantage of the vulnerability ofÂ theÂ web application server belonging to Yemek Sepeti, which was accessed by running a command. In addition, the decision confirms that the perpetrator(s) collected 21,504,083 individuals' data, which were forwarded to an IP address/server located in France.
Findings of the KVKK
In its findings, the KVKK highlighted that the data affected by the data breach included names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, passwords, and IP information.Â Thus, the decision notes that the breach was significant considering the number of people affected by the breach and the fact that nearlyÂ the entire customer database was leaked. In addition, the decision emphasises that the breach was not notified for eight days, which demonstrates that Yemek Sepeti was at fault in determining whether there was an infiltration or an action that should not have occurred. Therefore, the KVKK found that the company had not fulfilled its obligations to take all kinds of technical and administrative measures to ensure a sufficient level of security pursuant to Article 18(1)(b)Â of the Law.
Outcomes
Based on its investigation, the KVKK decided to impose a fine of TRY 1.9 million (approx. â‚¬122,130) to Yemek Sepeti for violations of Article 12(1)(a) of the Law, for failing to take technical and administrative measures to ensure data security in accordance to Article 18(1)(b) of the Law.

Moreover, the Court determined that, on the grounds thatÂ there presently exists no legislative measure with specific provisions in accordance with the mandatory requirements of Article 23(2) of the GDPR, the appeal should be approvedÂ as the immigration exemption is an unauthorised derogation from the fundamental rights conferred by the GDPR, and therefore incompatible with the same.

'''The Conservative Party published, on 3 October 2022, the speech of Michelle Donelan, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, at the 2022 Conservative Party Conference. In particular, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport ('DCMS'), Donelan outlined plans to create more wealth and prosperity through the tech, digital, cyber, creative, cultural, and arts sectors.
On the topic of data, Donelan announced that the DCMS will be replacing the system based on the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') with a data protection system that will protect consumer privacy, while also retaining data adequacy, which would allow businesses to trade freely. In place of the GDPR, Donelan noted that the DCMS will co-design the new system with businesses and consider those countries that achieve adequacy without having the GDPR, such as Israel, Japan, South Korea, Canada, and New Zealand.
According to Donelan, the new data protection plan will focus on growth and common sense, in addition to helping to prevent losses from cyber attacks and reducing regulations and elements that may stifle business. As such, Donelan highlighted that these plans would not create another wave of legislation on businesses, but rather simplify complicated legislation and avoid the pitfalls of a one-size-fits-all system.

In particular, the Commission noted that Ladbrokes had inadequate AML and social responsibilityÂ policies and processes, and insufficient staffing to support these systems.
Furthermore, the Commission stated thatÂ when LadbrokesÂ identified that its AML controls were insufficient, the changes implemented were insufficient to address the problem.Â In addition, the CommissionÂ identified an instance where LadbrokesÂ had noted concerns regarding the source of a customer's funds, but decided to allow the customer to gamble significant amounts of money,Â and did not conduct any further checks or interactions. Finally, the Commission directedÂ GVC to review the top 50 customers for the years 2015 to 2017 to see if further failings can be identified, and if so, they must divest themselves of profit.

Background to the case
In particular, the ICO outlined that, between 15 November 2019 and 15 July 2020, Bizfella has instigated the sending of 224,550 unsolicited direct marketing SMS messages that were received by subscribers.
Findings of the ICO
Further to the above, the ICO determined that Bizfella was required to ensure that it was acting in compliance with the requirements of Regulation 22 of the PECR and to ensure that valid consent was obtained, or that soft opt-in requirements were met, in order to send the SMS messages in question. Accordingly, the ICO highlighted that individuals made loan applications through one or more websites operated by Bizfella. Subsequently, the ICO found that Bizfella had instigated the sending of direct marketing messages to those individuals, for up to the next two years, to encourage them to apply again for a loan. In light of the same, the ICO explained that individuals could only proceed to submit their loan application if they ticked the box signifying acceptance to receiving SMS messages. Consequently, the ICO concluded that Bizfella had not obtained the necessary valid consent or satisfied the soft opt-in rule for 224,550 direct marketing messages.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 2 December 2021, its monetary penalty notice and enforcement notice, as issued on 15 November 2021, in which it imposed a fine of Â£500,000 on the Cabinet Office for violations of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following disclosure of the postal addresses of the 2020 New Year Honours recipients online.
Background to the notice
In particular, the notice provides that the Cabinet Office published, on 27 December 2019, a file on GOV.UK containing the names and unredacted addresses of more than 1,000 people announced in the New Year Honours list, including individuals from a range of professions and with a high public profile. Additionally, the notice highlights that, although the Cabinet Office removed the link to the file once it became aware of the data breach, the file was still cached and accessible online to people who had the exact webpage address, resulting in the access to the personal data of individuals 3,872 times, for a period of two hours and 21 minutes.
The ICO further noted that this, in turn, resulted in the ICO receiving three complaints from affected individuals who raised personal safety concerns resulting from the breach, whilst the Cabinet Office was also contacted by 27 individuals with similar concerns.
Findings of the ICO
The ICO found that the Cabinet Office failed to put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk associated with the processing of data for the purpose of the 2020 New Year Honours List, resulting in an infringement of the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR, as well as Article 32 of the GDPR.
Outcome
Within its notice of intent, the ICO proposed a penalty of Â£600,000, following which the Cabinet Office provided written representations stating, among other things, that it found the level of the fine to be disproportionate to the scale of the breach. As a result of considering such representations among other factors, the ICO imposed a penalty of Â£500,000 on the Cabinet Office, considering, among other things, that the acts were negligent, the effective cooperation and response of the Cabinet office, and the fact that the ICO has not been aware of any financial hardships or factors that would reduce the Cabinet Office's ability to pay.

In particular, the Statement notes that Cathay Pacific's computer systems lacked appropriate security measures between October 2014 and May 2018, which led to customers' personal details being exposed, 111,578 of whom were from the UK, and approximately 9.4 million more worldwide. In addition, the Statement outlines that the ICO found Cathay Pacific's systems were entered via a server connected to the internet and that malware was installed to harvest data.
Moreover, among the errors that were found during the ICO's investigation were back-up files that were not password protected, unpatched internet-facing servers, use of operating systems that were no longer supported by the developer, and inadequate anti-virus protection. Lastly, the Statement highlights that Cathay Pacific had acted promptly and forthrightly since it became aware of the data breach by issuing appropriate information to data subjects, employing a cybersecurity firm, and cooperating with the ICO.

'''The Information Commissioner Office ('ICO') issued, on 27 January 2021, a monetary penalty notice of Â£100,000 to Chameleon Marketing (H.I) LtdÂ for making 617,323 direct marketing calls to people registered with the Telephone Preference Service Ltd ('TPS') without obtaining consent, which resulted in 52 complaints from the public.

In particular, the monetary penalty notice highlights that, between 1 October 2018 and 21 January 2020, 274 complaints had been received by ICO's online reporting tool, as well as GSMA Ltd.'s Spam Reporting Service, about unlawful direct marketing texts sent by CCSL.
Furthermore, the penalty notice indicates thatÂ the ICO conducted an investigation into CCSL finding that the latter had violated Regulation 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), as no valid consent of the individuals was received. In addition, the penalty notice states that individuals applying for finance via one of the CCSL sites were given no option but to agree to receive direct marketing from CCSL and its unnamed third parties, and were further required to agree to a suite of contact methods, from an unknown number of third parties.
Among the factors considered for the imposition of this fine, were the seriousness and deliberate nature of the contravention, as well asÂ disregard by CCSL of the PECR in an effort to unlawfully generate income and profit. The amount of the fine will be reduced to Â£136,000, if CCSL proceeds with full payment of the same by 23 June 2021.

In particular, the decision notes that the calls which were made between August 2019 and March 2020, generated more than 500 complaints to the ICO and the TPS by TPS subscribers, which related to non-existent 'Green Deal'Â energy saving schemes, including boiler and window replacement, loft insulation and home improvement grants. In addition, the decision highlights that the complaints further suggested that DialADeal had used several generic and untraceable trading names, while the ICO's investigation found that the company also disguised the telephone numbers they were calling from, which was, according to the ICO, also illegal.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 16 March 2022, an enforcement notice and monetary penalty notice, issued on 14 March 2022, in which it imposed a fine of Â£80,000 to Domestic Support Limited, for violations of Regulations 21, 24, and 24(2) of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), following complaints about unsolicited marketing calls to vulnerable people.
Background to the case 
In particular, the ICO noted that it had received complaints by individuals registered on the Telephone Preference Service ('TPS') against Domestic Support for 69,113 unwanted marketing calls between January and July 2020 to people.
Findings of the ICO 
Following its investigation, the ICO found that between 1 January 2020 and 31 July 2020, Domestic SupportÂ used a public telecommunications service for the purposes of making 69,133 unsolicited direct marketing calls to subscribers on the TPS in violation of Regulations 21 and 24 of PECR, and was satisfied that this violation was deliberate where evidence suggests that Domestic Support made no apparent effort to establish that contacted individuals notified the TPS that they did not object to receiving such as required under Regulation 21(4) of the PECR.
Furthermore, the ICO noted that whilst there was evidence to suggest that Domestic Support, or at least one of the separate legal entities which held Domestic Support'sÂ registered office address as its own at the time, were carrying out some TPS checks on data, there was no explanation as to why these calls were made, and especially that such calls were made using different company names, which suggested that Domestic Support was deliberately attempting to deceive individuals as to its identity in violation of Regulation 24(2) of the PECR. In addition, the ICO expressed concerns over the sole data-purchase invoice showing that Domestic Support was purchasing records for homeowners specifically aged between 55 and 75 years old, which would indicate that older individuals were being targeted.
Outcome
Consequently, the ICO determined that Domestic Support was deliberate and predatory in its practices for direct marketing calls targeting elderly and vulnerable people in violation of Regulations 21 and 24 of the PECR, and thusÂ issued a fine of Â£80,000 to be paid by 13 April 2022. Alongside this, the ICO ordered Domestic Support to implement corrective measures when making public electronic communications of direct marketing purposes and neither use, nor instigate the use of, a public electronic communications service for the purposes of making unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes where the called line is subscribed to the TPS and has not informed that they do not object to receiving calls.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 6 October 2022, two monetary penalty notices, in which it imposed fines of Â£1.35 million and Â£130,000 on Easylife Ltd, for violations of Article 5(1)(a) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation ('UK GDPR') and Regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR') respectively, following investigations by the ICO and the receipt of several complaints.
Background to the decision
In particular, the ICO noted that it had conducted investigations into Easylife after the company had been brought to the ICO's attention. According to the ICO, while the investigation initially concerned contraventions of theÂ PECR, concerns regarding potential contraventions of the UK GDPR were also identified, which the ICO then investigated separately.
Findings of the ICO
In terms of violations under the UK GDPR, the ICO found that Easylife had used the personal information of 145,400 customers to predict their medical condition and target them with health-related products without their consent. More specifically, the ICO determined that significant profiling of customers and processing of health data had taken place and that such individuals had been unaware of the collection and use of their personal data for such purposes.
In terms of violations under the PECR, the ICO indicated that, between 1 August 2019 and 19 August 2020, Easylife had made 1,345,732 unwanted marketing calls to people registered with the Telephone Preference Service, which is prohibited under the PECR unless the recipient consents.
As such, the ICO concluded that Easylife had violated Article 5(1)(a) of the UK GDPR and Regulation 21 of the PECR.
Outcomes
In light of the above, the ICO imposed a fine of Â£1.35 million for the violation of the UK GDPR and a fine of Â£130,000 for the violation of the PECR, totalling Â£1.48 million. Furthermore, the ICO confirmed that payment of both fines must be made by 4 November 2022, while also noting that the fine for violating the PECR would be reduced by 20% to Â£104,000, if paid by 3 November 2022.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 1 December 2021, its monetary penalty notice and enforcement notice, as issued on 29 November 2021, in which it imposed a fine of Â£140,000 to EB Associates Group Limited, for violations of Regulation 21B of the Privacy and Electronic CommunicationsÂ (EC Directive)Â Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), and ordered EB Associates to stop making further calls about pensions or face court action, following an investigation into organisations which appeared to be making unsolicited direct marketing calls regarding pension schemes.
Background to theÂ notices
In particular, in response to an initial investigation letter from the ICO, the monetary penalty notice states that EB Associates informed the ICO that it had contracts in place with two Introducer Appointed Representatives ('IARs'), who would introduce it to interested individuals, adding that it did not carry out any marketing activities. Additionally, the ICO notedÂ that noÂ such contracts were provided during the course of the investigation, but that it also investigated both IARs. In these subsequent investigations, the ICO determined that, between 11 January 2019 and 30 September 2019, the IARS had made 107,003 unsolicited direct marketing calls to subscribers in relation to occupational pension schemes or personal pensions schemes, with those calls being instigated by EB Associates.
Findings of the ICO
Specifically, the ICO found that the IARs were not an authorised person or a person who is the trustee or manager of an occupational pension scheme or a personal pension scheme, whom are the only persons permitted to make such calls under Regulation 21B of the PECR. Citing a balance of probabilities and payment of fixed fees for each referral, among other things, the ICO concluded that EB Associates positively encouraged its IARs to make the calls on its behalf.
OutcomesÂ 
Consequently, the ICO determined that had contravened Regulation 21B of the PECR, and imposed the abovementioned fine of Â£140,000 on EB Associates to be paid by 5 January 2022, which may be subject to appeal. In calculation of the fine, the ICO considered that EB Associates had sought to generate leads for the purpose of financial gain, that the ICO publishes guidance online on direct marketing rules, and that it found EB Associates to have employed the IARs' services. Simultaneously, the ICO considered that EB Associates has sought advice from a third party compliance consultancy when engaging its IARs with a view to ensuring compliance with the PECR.Â 
In addition, the ICO ordered that EB Associates, within 30 days of the issuance of the enforcement notice, neither use or instigate the use of a public electronic communications service to make such calls in relation to pension schemes.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 20 January 2022, its enforcement notice, as issued on 18 January 2022, in which it imposed a fine ofÂ Â£2,000 on Energy Suite Limited, for violations of Regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), following complaints of unsolicited direct marketing calls.
Background to the notice
In particular, the ICO identified that there had been several complaints in respect of Energy Suite, namely three complaints to the Telephone Preference Service Ltd ('TPS') between 6 March and 20 July 2020 and one complaint to the ICO on 3 August 2020, by a complainant not registered for TPS, who explained that they received a direct marketing call from the Energy Suite, which informed the complainant that they obtained their personal data (full name and telephone number) from a third party, but refused to disclose who, noting that it was company policy to keep it secret. Therefore, the ICO noted its initiation of an investigation intoÂ the company on 13 November 2020.
Furthermore, in its investigation, the ICO considered the following:
In addition, the ICO outlined that the Energy Suite:
Findings of the ICO 
Moreover, in its findings, the ICO determined that on the balance of probabilities, between 1 March and 13 November 2020, Energy Suite made at least 1,246 connected calls to subscribers for the purpose of direct marketing, whose number was listed on the TPS register and had been on the register for at least 28 days prior to the call. Furthermore, the ICO clarified that whilst it is possible that some of the data subjects may have opted into marketing calls by submitting an enquiry on the Energy Suite's website, it was unable, when asked, to provide any detail of the calls made via website leads.
Consequently, the ICO found that pursuant to Regulation 21 of the PECR, these unsolicited direct marketing calls were made to subscribers who had registered with the TPS at least 28 days prior to receiving the calls, and who for the purposes of Regulation 21(4) of the PECR had not notified Energy Suite that they did not object to receiving such calls, noting that a notification must clearly indicate the individual's willingness to receive marketing calls specifically, wherebyÂ companies cannot rely on individuals opting into marketing communications generally, unless it is clear that this will include telephone calls. Therefore, the ICO noted that, where signing up to use a product or service is conditional upon receiving marketing calls, companies will need to demonstrate how this constitutes a clear and positive notification of the individual's willingness to receive such calls. In this regard, the ICO highlighted its readily available guidance for companies carrying out marketing explaining their legal requirements under PECR.
Outcomes
Lastly,Â the ICO found it appropriate to impose a fine of Â£2,000 on Energy Suite for violationÂ of Regulation 21 of the PECR to be paid by 17 February 2022, and noted the company's right to appeal to the Information Rights Tribunal.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 13Â April 2022, its monetary penalty notice, in which it imposed a fine of Â£60,000 to Finance Giant Ltd, for violations of Regulations 22 and 23 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), following reports of messages through the 7726-spam reporting system for unsolicited direct marketing messages.
Background to the case
In particular, the ICO outlined that, between 1 and 30 November 2020, Finance Giant had transmitted 40,524 direct marketing text messages and 465,235 direct marketing emails to subscribers via sendinblue.com platform, respectively, 27,608 and 445,138 of which were received.
Findings of the ICO
In light of the above, the ICO determined that the direct marketing communications were unsolicited communications for lack of data subject's consent to the communications, despiteÂ Finance Giant claiming that it had done so as part of its agreement to the terms and conditions and privacy policy during the application process. In this regard, the ICO did not agree with Finance Giant's suggestion that this constituted consent, but ratherÂ that the application process enables applicants only to signify their agreement to the terms and conditions but not to the direct marketing communications, and highlighted the absence of a separate opt-in or opt-out box to enable applicants either to consent or withdraw consent specifically in relation to direct marketing messages as well as informing applicants that direct marketing messages will be sent, unless they separately consult the terms of its privacy policy. Therefore, the ICO clarified that this communication violated Regulation 22 of the PECR.
Furthermore, the ICO outlined that 27,608 direct marketing SMS did not contain any opt-out to enable data subjects to stop receiving further messages from Finance Giant and thus in violation of Regulation 23 of the PECR.
In addition, the ICO considered that Finance Giant's conduct in unsolicited direct marketing were deliberate actions which constituted the violations of the PECR even if Finance Giant did not actually intend to do so.
Outcomes
Consequently, the ICO imposed, within the monetary penalty notice, a financial penalty of Â£60,000 to be paid by 11 May 2022 at the latest, but provided the possibility of a 20% reduction to Â£48,000 should it be paid by 10 May 2022, and clarified Finance Giant's rights to a right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (Information Rights).

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') announced, on 11 January 2018, that it had issued overall fines of Â£600,000 to Barrington Claims Limited, TFLI Limited, Newday Ltd and Goody Market UK Ltd for serious contraventions of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR').
In particular, Barrington Claims was fined Â£250,000 for its failure to ensure that automated marketing calls were sent to individuals who had consented to receive marketing under Regulation 19 of PECR. The ICO took into account the fact that Barrington Claims had instigated over 15 million calls, hadÂ its claims management authorisation removed by the Ministry of Justice and had failed to cooperate in the investigations, as well as failing to identify the organisation sending or instigating the automated marketing calls.Â Furthermore, Newday Ltd was issued a Â£230,000 fine for instigating, through affiliates, the transmission of approximately 48,096,988 emarketing messages while relying upon invalid consent obtained by third party affiliates, in breach of Regulation 22 of PECR. The ICO based the amount of the fine on the fact that the actions leading to the contravention were deliberate or foreseeable.
TFLI Limited was fined Â£80,000 for instigating the sending of approximately 1,190,534 automated unsolicited SMS marketing messages in contravention of Regulation 22 of PECR. Finally, Goody Market UK was issued a fine of Â£40,000 for instigating the transmission of 170,000 unsolicited text messages on the basis of data sourced from a third party and purchased on behalf of Good Market UK by a data broker.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 31 March 2022, its monetary penalty notice, in which it imposed a fine of Â£80,000 on H&L Business Consulting Ltd, for the violation of Regulations 22 and 23 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), following 314 complaints from subscribers.
Background to the decision
In particular, the notice notes that H&L sent, between 20 January 2020 and 27 July 2020, 451,705 SMS messages, of which 378,538 were delivered, and which were unsolicited direct marketing messages sent to subscribers who had not consented to receiving them. Additionally, the notice states that the spam messages promoted a 'government-backed' debt management scheme, despite the fact that the company was not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority to provide regulated financial products or services.
Findings of the ICO
Additionally, the ICO found that H&L deliberately contravened Regulations 22 and 23 of the PECR, highlighting that the company's directorÂ should have been aware of the requirements of the PECR, having been a director of at least 11 companies between 2005 and 2020. Specifically, the notice highlights that the director was previously investigated with regards to their connection with PECR non-compliance of a different company, failing to cooperate with the 2019 ICO investigation and instead setting up a new company, H&L, with the apparent intention of concealing their activities from the ICO.
Outcomes
As a result, the ICO issued a fine of Â£80,000 to H&L, as well as an enforcement notice, ordering the same to stop, within 30 days of the receipt of the notice:
Lastly, the monetary penalty notice provides that if H&L proceeds with payment by 27 April 2022, the amount of the fine will be reduced by 20& to Â£64,000.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 6 September 2022, its monetary penalty notice, issued on 2 September 2022, to Halfords Limited for violation of Regulation 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), following the receipt of a complaint about an unsolicited direct marketing email.
Background to the decision
In particular, the ICO noted that an individual submitted a complaint that Halfords had sent an email regarding a government bike repair scheme without their consent.
Findings of the ICO
As a result of the ICO's investigation, it determined that the email had been sent to 513,587 customers who had not previously opted-in to marketing, 498,179 of which were received, and that all customers had purchased a bike from Halfords within the last three years. In response, the ICO noted that Halfords argued that the email constituted a service message, and should not be categorised as direct marketing. Nevertheless, the ICO maintained that the content of the email did constitute direct marketing, given the inclusion of some promotional material sufficient to satisfy the definition under Paragraph 35 of the ICO's Direct Marketing Guidance. Furthermore, the ICO concluded that the soft opt-in exemption could not apply since the targeted recipients had already opted out of marketing, and were in any event denied the opportunity of opting out at the point of receiving the email since it did not contain a simple means to refuse the use of their contact details for direct marketing purposes, contrary to Regulation 22(3)(c) of the PECR.
Outcomes
Ultimately, the ICO imposed a fine of Â£30,000 on Halfords to be paid by 5 October 2022, noting that payment by 4 October 2022 would reduce the monetary penalty by 20% to Â£24,000.

The ICO highlighted that, although the sensitive personal data on the USB memory stick constituted a small amount of the total files, Â it also contained a training video,Â which exposed ten individuals' personal data including passport numbers, and that of up to 50 Heathrow employees.
In addition, the ICO found that only 2% of the 6,500 employees had received data protection training, and expressed concern over Heathrow's ineffective system in preventing personal data from being downloaded unto unauthorised media.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') announced, on 18 August 2017, that it had fined Home Logic UK Ltd Â£50,000 for making marketing calls to individuals who had registered themselves on the Telephone Preference Service ('TPS') register. According to the ICO, Home Logic licensed the numbers it used to make marketing calls from third-party providers and then uploaded that data to an electronic dialler system, which screened the numbers against the TPS register. The electronic dialler system was, however, unavailable for 90 days out of 220 between April 2015 and March 2016 due to technical issues, and on those days, the ICO noted that Home Logic made unsolicited marketing calls without any alternative screening against the TPS register.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 16 March 2022, an enforcement notice and monetary penalty notice, issued on 14 March 2022, in which it imposed a fine of Â£100,000 on Home Sure Solutions Ltd, for violations of Regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), following complaints about unsolicited marketing calls to vulnerable people.
Background to the case 
In particular, the ICO noted that it had received complaints from people registered on the Telephone Preference Service ('TPS')Â against Home Sure for 229,483 unsolicited direct marketing calls between March 2020 and September 2020.
Findings of the ICO 
Following its investigation, the ICO found that Home Sure had violated Regulation 21 of the PECR when it deliberately made 229,438 unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers on the TSP and to subscribers who did not notify Home Sure that they did not object to such calls as required under Regulation 21(4) of the PECR. In addition, the ICO found that this violation was evidenced by Home Sure, among other things, for failing to provide any evidence that the subscribers had not objected to its unsolicited direct marketing calls, which it made having purchased data from a third-party data provider following mere assurances of veracity and failed to provide any satisfactory evidence of due diligence being conducted in respect of the data which it was choosing to purchase.
Moreover, the ICO considered the following in its investigation, Home Sure had used pressured sales tactics apparent mis-selling of products and services which subscribers had clearly not anticipated receiving, and Home SureÂ had requested a quote by its third-party data provider for data specifically relating to individuals aged 60+, suggesting that it deliberately targeted vulnerable people to generate cashflow and profit.
Outcome
Consequently, the ICO issued a fine of Â£80,000, to be paid by 14 April 2022, and issued an enforcement notice where it ordered Home Sure to neither use, nor instigate the use of, a public electronic communications service for the purposes of making unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes where the called line is subscribed to the TPS and has not informed that they do not object to receiving calls.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 2 February 2022, its enforcement notice and monetary penalty notice, issued on 31 January 2022, in which it imposed a fine ofÂ Â£200,000 to Home2Sense Ltd, for violations of Regulations 21 and 24 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), following complaints about unsolicited marketing calls.
Background to the caseÂ Â 
In particular, the ICO reported that, on 13 May 2021, it had sent an initial investigation letter, along with a spreadsheet of complaints, to Home2Sense, following 33 complaints for unsolicited marketing calls. More specifically, the ICOÂ requested evidence that the individualsÂ registered on the Telephone Preference Service Limited ('TPS')Â had notified Home2Sense that they did not object to its calls (i.e.Â that they had consented to receive direct marketing calls), to which Home2Sense responded by providing documentation authorising its accountant to act on its behalf as a representative.
However, the ICO noted that the appointed representative failed to co-operate and fulfilÂ the ICO's requests, for example, in response to the ICO's query for the source of the data used in its campaigns, the representative stated that the data was acquired from an unknown source and that no data was obtained from customers directly, to which the ICO replied that it is inconceivable to not be able to confirm who its third-party data providers were.Â 
Therefore, the ICO noted its view of the refusal to provide the information only as an attempt to obstruct its investigation, and the company's dismissive response, coupled with its failure to disclose any details of its call dialler records ('CDRs') or any other information which might assist the investigation, showed a complete disregard for the rights of the individuals whom it sought to contact.
Findings of the ICOÂ Â 
Following its investigation, the ICO found that between 23 June and 31 March 2021, Home2Sense used a public telecommunications service for the purposes of making 675,478 unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers, where the called line was a number listed on the register of numbers kept by the ICO contrary to Regulation 21(1)(b) of the PECR, and noted that the calls were made to subscribers who had registered with the TPS at least 28 days prior to receiving the calls.Â 
In particular, the ICO held that Home2Sense failed, as required by Regulation 24 of the PECR, to provide the recipient of the calls with the particulars specified in Regulation 24(2) of the PECR, where it used seemingly interchangeable trading styles, which could not be attributed to Home2Sense.Â 
Furthermore, the ICO deemed that the violations committed by Home2Sense were negligent and deliberate andÂ exercised in its attempt to deflect responsibility to its staff, indicating that it was beyond its control to ensure staff screened data against the TPS register prior to making calls, whilst failing to provide any evidence that such TPS checks were actually carried out andÂ any training materials for its staff.
Outcome
Consequently, the ICO decided, considering the seriousness of the contravention, the negligent behaviour of Home2Sense in the investigation process, and its business activities regarding marketing calls in the absence of mitigating measures, to issue an enforcement notice ordering Home2Sense to stop making unsolicited marketing calls, as well as a monetary penalty of Â£200,000 for violations of Article 21 and 24 of the PECR.

As a result, the decision highlightedÂ that the House Guards were in breach of Regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), and additionally, the decision notedÂ that the ICO, in issuing the monetary penalty, took into account aggravating factors including a deliberate action for financial or personal gainÂ through the generation of leads via marketing calls, and ignorance of the ICO's advice and guidance.

In addition,Â IAG Nationwide was issued an enforcement notice ordering it to stop illegal marketing.
Andy Curry, Enforcement Group Manager at the ICO, said, ""Both these firms showed disregard for both the law and people's right to privacy when they embarked on their unlawful marketing campaigns. We heard about the harassing nature of the calls made by IAG Nationwide, whilst Costelloe and Kelly ploughed ahead with their spam texts despite the fact the content was about funeral plans - a sensitive area which could cause upset to recipients. Reports from the public about these firms helped our investigations, leading to action to hold those responsible to account.

Bagnall's employer, Nationwide Accident Repair Services Limited ('NARS') called in cybersecurity consultants after large numbers of customers began complaining that they were receiving nuisance calls shortly after engaging its services. Initial enquiries led to suspicions that Bagnall was involved and it was decided that his access to the company's computer systems would be monitored. During a week that Bagnall's accesses were monitored, he accessed the data of 2,724 customers without his employer's consent. Customers whose data was accessed subsequently received unsolicited and at times aggressive marketing calls regarding their accidents and they were asked whether they wanted to pursue legal claims.

The ICO highlighted that MyHome Installations was unable to provide any evidence of consent due to a previous marketing manager historically buying the data and adding it to their call lists without any reference to its source.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 17 December 2021, its monetary penalty notice and enforcement notice, as issued on 15 December 2021, in which it imposed a fine of Â£75,000 to Northern Gas & Power Limited, for violations of Regulation 21(1)(a) and 21(1)(b) of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation, 2003 ('PECR'), following direct marketing calls made to subscribers who were registered with the Telephone Preference Service ('TPS') or Corporate TPS.
Background to theÂ notices
In particular, the ICO identified that the TPS had received 103 complaints about unsolicited direct marketing calls between 1 May 2019 and 30 April 2020 and that the ICO had received 62 such complaints over the same period. As a result, the ICO launched an investigation into the same.
Findings of the ICO
Consequently, the ICO found that, between 1 May 2019 and 31 March 2021, Northern Gas & Power used a public telecommunications service for the purposes of making unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers where the number allocated to the subscriber was listed in the register under Regulation 26, contrary to Regulation 21(1)(b) of the PECR. In addition, the ICO determined that Northern Gas & Power had used a public telecommunications service for the purposes of making unsolicited direct marketing calls where the number allocated to the subscriber had already notified that such calls should not be made, contrary to Regulation 21(1)(a) of the PECR. Furthermore, the Commission found that Northern Gas & Power had not been able to demonstrate that the TPS or CTPS subscribers had given prior notification or valid consent to receive such calls. Moreover, in terms of the severity of the contravention, the ICO noted, among other things, that the number of complaints received may represent only a small proportion of the actual number of breaches. In terms of mitigating factors, the ICO recognised that Northern Gas & Power had confirmed that it had purchased its own TPS licence, as well as call screening and blocking software.
Outcomes
Ultimately, the ICO imposed a fine for the sum of Â£75,000, which had been reduced from Â£80,000 in light of the aforementioned mitigating factor, and which must be paid by 18 January 2022 at the latest. Payment by 17 January 2022 would result in a 20% reduction of the penalty to Â£60,000.
Additionally, in the enforcement notice, the ICO orderedÂ Northern Gas & Power, within 30 days of the issuance date, to neither use, nor instigate use of, a public electronic communications service for the purposes of making unsolicited calls as a means of of direct marketing, where the called line is that of either a subscriber who had previously notified Northern Gas & Power that such calls should not be made, or a subscriber who had registered their number with the TPS or CTPS at least 28 days previously and who had not notified Northern Gas & Power that they do not object to such calls.

In particular, the ICO outlined that a number of complaints about OSL had been reported to the 7726 spam text reporting service and that OSL had reused personal data for marketing purposes that was previously obtained from individuals who had contacted it through its website to obtain a quote.
Furthermore, the ICO highlighted that, since the individuals were not offered the choice to opt in or out of marketing, valid consent had not been obtained. Therefore, the ICO found OSL to be in violation of Regulation 23 of the PECR and issued a fine of Â£50,000, to be paid by 5 January 2021 at the latest. In calculation of the fine, the ICO considered factors such as the lack of transparency and cooperation in provision of financial documents to prove any evidence of financial hardship, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In particular, the notice highlights that Papa John's practices came to the attention of the ICO following 15 complaints from its customers regarding text messages, for which Papa John's was unable to evidence consent.
In addition, the notice outlines, among other things, that Papa John's failed to provide its customers with a simple means of refusing the use of their contact details for direct marketing. Furthermore, the notice highlights that the ICO identified the contravention as serious and negligent.Â More specifically, the ICOÂ considered that an aggravating feature of the case was the fact that the actions of Papa John's were carried out to generate business and to increase profits, gaining an unfair advantage on those businesses complying with the PECR. However, the ICO also consideredÂ that a mitigating feature was Papa John's temporary suspension of marketing to individuals placing orders by telephone.
The notice states thatÂ if Papa John's pays the monetary penalty by 8 July 2021, the same will be dropped to Â£8,000.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') announced, on 19 August 2021, that it had imposed a fine of Â£50,000 to Parkin Beacher Ltd, trading under Your Pension Options, for making illegal marketing calls to individuals about their pensions. In particular, the ICO outlined that Parkin Beacher made approximately 16 unsolicited calls to individualsÂ in relation to occupational pension schemes or personal pension schemes contrary to Regulation 21B of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, 2003 ('PECR'), without being authorised to do so, as well as 96,817 direct marketing calls of which Parkin Beacher has not confirmed how many connected.
Furthermore, the ICO found that Parkin Beacher sourced the dataÂ from a third-party supplier which obtained the data from various websites that required those signing up to agree to possible marketing from long lists of sectors and organisations, without allowing individuals to select which, if any, they consented to having their details passed on to, or to receive marketing material from. Consequently, the ICO determined that Parkin Beacher did not have informed consent from the recipients of its calls. In addition, the ICO issued an enforcement notice ordering Parkin Beacher to stop making further calls.

Background to the case
In particular, the ICO outlined that Reed provides a platform to assist users with finding work and career enhancement, and that an investigation commenced following the receipt of complaints regarding marketing emails sent by Reed which invited individuals to submit their CVs to be reviewed by an organisation.
Findings of the ICO
Further to the above, the ICO noted that Reed explained that emails had been sent due to human error. Notably, the ICO determined that, of 16,983,447 emails, 77,101 recipients clicked on the link to claim a free CV review, andÂ 256,418 clicked on the unsubscribe link. Furthermore, the ICO noted that, of the 6,250,966 emails sent to individuals unsubscribed to receiving marketing emails, 37,011 clicked on the link to claim a free CV review, and 227,063 clicked on the unsubscribe link.
More specifically, the ICO found that, between 4Â and 7 February 2021, 6,250,966 direct marketing emails were received by subscribers without their consent, in violation of Regulation 22 of the PECR. Although Reed noted that there was no intention to send the emails for the purposes of direct marketing, the ICO remained satisfied that intention is not a necessary element to determining contravention of Regulation 22 of the PECR.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') announced, on 29 October 2020, that it had fined Reliance Advisory Limited, a claims management services company, Â£250,000 for sending 15.1 million nuisance calls over a six-month period from the start of 2019, in violation of regulation 21A of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 ('PECR') and under Section 55A of the Data Protection Act 1998 which allows the ICO to issue a monetary penalty notice for serious contraventions of the PECR. In particular, the ICO outlined that it had received 85 complaints from members of the public about the persistent calls being made. More specifically, Reliance Advisory highlighted that the data used for its calls was purchased from a third party data provider, however, where evidence for consent to calls existed, the consent was found to have not been freely given, specific, or informed since individuals were unable to proceed to the third party website without providing consent to the use of personal data.
Furthermore, Reliance Advisory indicated that it was not aware of its responsibilities under the law, notably regulation 21A of the PECR which bans unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes in relation to claims management services. In consideration of whether the violations were deliberate, the ICO did not find Reliance Advisory to have deliberately intended to contravene PECR, although it had failed to take reasonable steps to consult ICO guidance, for instance, and familiar itself with the relevant legislation as part of due diligence. Regarding the calculation of the fine, the ICO considered, among other things, that the Reliance Advisory appeared to have employed aggressive and rude practices during the calls and that the purpose of the calls was financial gain. As a result, the ICO decided to issue a monetary penalty of Â£250,000 which must be paid by 27 November 2020 at the latest, or can be reduced to Â£200,000 if paid by 26 November 2020.

'''The Information Commissioner Office ('ICO') issued, on 27 January 2021, a monetary penalty notice of Â£180,000 and an enforcement notice to Repair & Assure Limited for making 1,103,292 nuisance calls, resulting in the ICO, as well as the Telephone Preference Service Ltd ('TPS'), receiving 88 complaints about the calls, all of which related to washing machine warranties. In particular, the monetary penalty notes, despite Repair & Assure initially advising the ICO that its 'opt in' dataÂ was obtained from 12 third party suppliersÂ without screening against the TPS register, it was subsequently found that all the data was collected via telephone marketing surveys. In addition, the monetary penalty notice highlights that this violated Regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR') which applies to the making of unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes, meaning that if a company wants to make calls promoting a product or service to an individual who has a telephone number which is registered with the TPS, then that individual must have given their consent to that company to receive such calls.
Further to this, the monetary penalty notice provides that informed consent cannot be established when an individual has been asked to agree to third party marketing prior to being informed who the third-party organisations actually are, and that in terms of the data supplier surveys, the third parties were provided after the apparent consent was obtained and the data suppliers had conflated the agreement to marketing with a veiled request which made the purpose of the call misleading. In addition, the monetary penalty states that Repair & Assure must pay the monetary penalty by 25 February 2021 at the latest, and if the funds are received by 24 February 2021, the ICO will reduce the monetary penalty by 20% to Â£144,000. Lastly, the ICO issued an enforcement notice to Repair & Assure, ordering it to stop making marketing calls within 30 days, where the called line is that of a subscriber who has previously notified Repair & Assure that such calls should not be made on that line, and/or a subscriber who has registered their number with the TPS at least 28 days previously and who has not notified Repair & Assure that they do not object to such calls being made.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') announced, on 6 April 2018, that it had fined Royal Mail Group Limited Â£12,000 for sending over 300,000 direct marketing emails to individuals who had already opted out of receiving such communications. According to the ICO, Royal Mail argued that the emails, which outlined a reduction in price for parcels, were a service rather than marketing. The ICO found, however, that the emails constituted marketing and not simply a service message, therefore breaching Regulation 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003.
Steve Eckersley, Head of Enforcement at the ICO, said, ""Royal Mail did not follow the law on direct marketing when it sent such a huge volume of emails, because the recipients had already clearly expressed they did not want to receive them. These rules are there for a reason - to protect people from the irritation and, on occasions, distress nuisance emails cause. I hope this sends the message that we will take action against companies who flout them.""

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 8 March 2022, its monetary penalty notice, issued on 7 March 2022, in which it imposed a fine of Â£20,000 on Royal Mail Group Limited, for violation of Regulation 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), following an investigation into a breach, thought to be triggered by a technicalÂ error.
Background to the case
In particular, the ICO noted that, on 27 April 2021, Royal Mail had sent a total of 215,202 direct marketing emails to individuals for whom it did not hold valid consent, of those 213,191 direct marketing emails were received by subscribers. Although it initially reported that the breach occurred due to a technical error, Royal Mail later confirmed that it was caused by a manual error.
Findings of the ICO
Following its investigation, the ICO determinedÂ that Royal Mail did not have the necessary valid consent for the 213,191 direct marketing messages received by subscribers. The ICOÂ further found that forÂ individuals who had checked out as guests, i.e. those who did not create a Royal Mail account, Royal Mail could not rely on soft opt-in as it cannot be said that individuals were given a simple means of refusing the use of their contact details for the purposes of such direct marketing, at the time that the details were initially collected. Therefore, the ICO stated that Royal Mail, in its conduct of sending advertising materials of post stampsÂ via email, constituted unsolicited communications by means of electronic mail to individual subscribers and thus violatedÂ Regulation 22 of the PECR.Â 
Furthermore, in calculation of the fine, the ICO consideredÂ that previous action had been taken against Royal Mail for a contravention of Regulation 22 of the PECR, at which point it would have been provided with clear advice as to compliance with the same.
Outcome
Consequently, the ICOÂ concluded that it was appropriate to issue a fine of Â£20,000 to Royal Mail, to be paid by 6 April 2022.

Background to the case 
In particular, the ICO noted that between it had received complaints from people registered on the Telephone Preference Service ('TPS')Â against Seaview for 4,737 unsolicited direct marketing calls in June 2020.
Findings of the ICO 
Following its investigation, the ICO found that Seaview had violated Regulation 21 of the PECR when it negligently made 4,737 unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers on the TSP and to subscribers who did not notify Seaview that they did not object to such calls, as required under Regulation 21(4) of the PECR. In particular, the ICO found that Seaview was unable to provide any evidence that the subscribers who received these calls had notified Seaview that they did not, for the time being, object to such calls, and evidence of an example consent statement used to gather consent by the data providers via a lifestyle survey did not appear to comply with PECR as individuals were not informed about who may contact them with marketing, or were able to choose who they receive marketing from.
Outcome
Consequently, the ICO issued a fine of Â£15,000, to be paid by 13 April 2020, and issued an enforcement notice where it ordered Seaview to neither use, nor instigate the use of, a public electronic communications service for the purposes of making unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes where the called line is subscribed to the TPS and has not informed that they do not object to receiving calls.

In particular, the penalty notice highlights that the contravention was negligent and that Solarwave failed to carry out adequate due diligence checks on its third-party data providers, while also failing to show that it had adequate contracts in place. In addition, the penalty notice outlines that Solarwave neglected to ensure that the data purchased had been screened against the TPS every 28 days as required.
As a result of this contravention, the penalty notice highlights that Solarwave was in violation of Regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 ('PECR'). Among the aggravating factors considered to impose this penalty were the fact that the complaints received by both the ICO and the TPS suggest that Solarwave was seen to be rude and persistent when making calls, ignoredÂ requests to cease such calls, and thatÂ the actions of Solarwave were carried out to generate business and to increase profits, gaining an unfair advantage on those businesses complying with the PECR.

In particular, the monetary penalty notice outlines that, upon receipt of the Commissioner's initial investigation correspondence, it appears that Studio MG closed its account with its platform provider and deleted a database containing evidence of the volume of emails that had been sent, however adding that Studio MG has since advised that it had stopped sending direct marketing emails. Furthermore, the ICO noted that the contacts were collated from, among other sources, the company director's LinkedIn and email contacts. Specifically, the monetary penalty notice finds that the marketing sought to exploit and capitalise on the current pandemic given, for instance, the scraping of data from a variety ofÂ sources with no attempt to obtain valid consent and the divergence from the companies usual activities as a software consultancy.
Regarding the calculation of a fine, the monetary penalty notice adds that Studio MG had failed to demonstrate that it would suffer undue financial hardship in the event of a penalty or provide financial information beyond its 2019 figures. In addition, the enforcement notice requests that the company cease any such activity within 30 days and the monetary penalty notice highlights that the penalty will be reduced by 20% to Â£32,000 if it is paid by 5 November 2020.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') announced, on 10 August 2017, that it had fined TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Â£100,000 for failure to take appropriate technical and organisational measures against unlawful and unauthorised processing of customer data, in violation of the seventh data protection principle of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998.
According to the ICO, the breach surfaced in September 2014 when TalkTalk Telecom Group started receiving complaints from customers that they were receiving calls from scammers, who had quoted customers' addresses and TalkTalk Telecom Group account numbers. Further to an ICO investigation, it was revealed that the issue lay with a TalkTalk Telecom Group portal through which customer information could be accessed by its data processors, including Wipro Limited, to resolve complaints and network coverage problems on TalkTalk Telecom Group's behalf.
A specialist investigation by TalkTalk Telecom Group identified three Wipro accounts that had been used to gain unauthorised and unlawful access to the personal data of up to 21,000 customers. 40 Wipro employees had access to data of between 25,000 and 50,000 TalkTalk Telecom Group customers and were able to log in to the portal from any internet-enabled device and view large numbers of customer records at a time and to export data.
The ICO found the level of access was unjustifiably wide-ranging, which put customer data at risk, and that TalkTalk Telecom Group should have made sure the portal could only be accessed from authorised devices. In addition, the ICO highlighted that TalkTalk Telecom Group should have been aware of the risks and increasing prevalence of scams and attempted frauds, and that it therefore should have assessed the measures it had in place to mitigate against them.

Specifically, the ICO found that, between 26 May 2019 and 26 May 2020, there were 29,970,419 unsolicited direct marketing messages received by subscribers. Following this, the ICO sent an initial investigation letter to Tempcover, outlining concerns regarding its compliance with the PECR, and asking a series of questions in relation to its direct marketing text message campaigns.
Findings of the ICO
Additionally, the ICO's investigation and assessment of Tempcover's response revealed, among other things, that, at the time an individual submitted their details, they were not provided with a separate option to either opt in to or opt out of direct marketing, and thatÂ Tempcover used an individual's mandatory agreement to the website's terms and conditions and privacy policy as the basis on which to conduct its direct marketing campaign, acting under the belief that it could rely on 'legitimate interest'.
As a result, the ICO found that Tempcover transmitted those direct marketing messages, contrary to Regulation 22 of the PECR. Therefore, the ICOÂ was satisfied that the contravention was serious and that Tempcover failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the violation. In reaching itsÂ decision, the ICO considered aggravating factors, including the fact that Temcover would have benefited financially from its unlawful actions, as well as mitigating factors, including Tempcover's changes to its practices in light of the ICO's investigation, allowing subscribers to opt out of unsolicited direct marketing at the point at which consent is obtained.
Outcomes
As such, the ICO fined Temcover Â£85,000,Â which will be reduced by 20% to Â£68,000 if the ICO receives full payment of the monetary penalty by 8 March 2022.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 17 February 2022, its enforcement notice and monetary penalty notice, in which it imposed a fine of Â£50,000 to The Money Hive Limited, for violations of Regulation 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), following receipt of 1,360 complaints regarding unsolicited direct marketing messages.
Background to the case
In particular, the ICO outlined that, between 12 March and 8 September 2020, The Money Hive had transmitted 807,382 direct marketing text messages to subscribers via two platform providers, 752,425 of which were received.
Findings of the ICO
In light of the above, the ICO determined that the messages were unsolicited as the platform providers advertised themselves as purely online services, as means of obtaining a short-term loan offer. However, the ICO highlighted that, in order to proceed with the online application, individuals were required to agree to receive an undefined number of contacts via text, email, and telephone from The Money Hive and its third-party partners. In this regard, the ICO did not agree with The Money Hive's suggestion that the messages were service messages instead of direct marketing messages, as they advertised the availability of loan products from both The Money Hive and third-party providers, and, as such, fall under the definition of direct marketing under Section 122(5) of the Data Protection Act 2018. Furthermore, the ICO noted that The Money Hive cannot rely on the soft opt-in exemption provided by Regulation 22(3) of the PECR as individuals were unable to opt-out.
In addition, the ICO considered that The Money Hive did not deliberately intend to contravene the PECR in this instance, but that it had failed toÂ take reasonable steps to prevent the contraventions.
Outcomes
Consequently, the ICO imposed, within the monetary penalty notice, a financial penalty of Â£50,000 to be paid by 16 March 2022 at the latest, but provided the possibility of a 20% reduction to Â£40,000 should it be paid by 15 March 2022. Within the enforcement notice, the ICO required The Money Hive to neither transmit, nor instigate the transmission of unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing by means of email unless the recipient has previously notified The Money Hive that they have clearly and specifically consented to such communications.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') announced, on 8 July 2021, that it had issued transgender charity Mermaids with a monetary penalty notice of Â£25,000 for contraventions of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the notice highlights that Mermaids failed to implement an appropriate level of organisational and technical security to its internal email systems, which resulted in documents or emails containing personal data, including in some cases relating to children and/orÂ special category data, being searchable and viewable online by third parties through internet search engine results.
Specifically, the notice outlines that around 780 pages of confidential emails were visible online, which included sensitive data relating to gender incongruence and personal data relating to 550 data subjects, such as name, email address, job title, or employer's name, further noting that Mermaids should have applied restricted access to its email group and could have considered pseudonymisation or encryption to add an extra layer of protection to the personal data it held. In deciding the amount of the fine, the ICO considered, among other things, the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing concerned and the negligent character of the infringement.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 10 March 2022, its monetary penalty notice, issued on 28 February 2022, in which it imposed a fine of Â£98,000 on Tuckers Solicitors LLP, for violations of Articles 5(1)(f),Â  32(1)(a), and 32(1)(b)Â of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a ransomware attack on its systems.
Background to the case
In particular, the ICO noted that following a ransomware attack on its archive servers on 24 August 2020, Tuckers submitted a personal data breach notification to the ICO the following day, in which Tuckers outlined that 972,191 individual files were encrypted, of these, 60 court bundles were exfiltrated by the attacker and published on an underground market site. In particular, the ICO outlined that the bundles included a comprehensive set of sensitive personal data, including medical files, witness statements, names, addresses of witnesses and victims, and the alleged crimes of the individuals.
Findings of the ICO
In light of the above, the ICO found that Tuckers failed to put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk associated with the processing of data for the purpose of their business, resulting in a violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR, as well as Article 32 of the GDPR.
In particular, the ICO outlined its considerations in assessing the adequacy of Tuckers' technical and organisational measures over the relevant period related to the following:
As such, the ICO stated that Tuckers had therefore violated Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1)(b) of the GDPR.
In addition, the ICO found that Tuckers failed to ensure appropriate security by encryption of personal data, where it stored archive bundles in unencrypted and plain text format, resulting in a failure to protect against unauthorised and unlawful processing of its personal data in violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1)(a) of the GDPR.
As a result, the ICO considered it appropriate, on the basis that the contraventions were sufficiently serious, to issue a penalty of Â£98,000.
Outcomes
Moreover, in addition to issuing the penalty, the ICO also imposed corrective measures. Finally, the ICO clarified that Tuckers is entitled to the right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal within 28 days of the date of the penalty notice.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 16 March 2022, an enforcement notice and monetary penalty notice, as issued on 14 March 2022, in which it imposed a fine of Â£100,000 on UK Appliance Cover Limited, for violations of Regulation 21 and 24(2) of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'), following complaints about unsolicited marketing calls to vulnerable people.
Background to the case 
In particular, the ICO noted that it had received complaints from individuals registered on the Telephone Preference Service ('TPS') against UK ApplianceÂ for 39,167 unsolicited direct marketing calls between June and December 2020.
Findings of the ICO 
Following its investigation, the ICO found that UK Appliance violated Regulations 21 and 24 of the PECRÂ when it negligently made 39,167 unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers on the TPS,Â and to subscribers who did not notify UKACL that they did not object to such calls as required under Regulation 21(4) of the PECR. In addition, the ICO found that UK Appliance failed to provide information to identify itself and did not accurately identify itself to recipients of the calls in accordance with Regulation 24(2) of the PECR.
Outcome
Consequently, the ICO issued a fine of Â£100,000, to be paid by 13 April 2022, and issued an enforcement notice where it ordered UK Appliance to neither use, nor instigate the use of, a public electronic communications service for the purposes of making unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes, where the called line is subscribed to the TPS and has not informed that they do not object to receiving calls, and where a public electronic communications service is used for the transmission of a communication for direct marketing purposes, the recipient should be provided with the name of the person and ether the address or telephone number on which they can be reached free of charge.

Background to the case 
In particular, the ICO noted that between it had received complaints from individuals registered on the Telephone Preference Service ('TPS') against Platinum Home Care forÂ 412,556 unsolicited direct marketing calls between 4 March and 8 October 2020.
Findings of the ICO 
Following its investigation, the ICO found that Platinum Home Care violated Regulation 21 of the PECR when it deliberately made 4,737 unsolicited aggressive and manipulative calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers on the TPS, and to subscribers who did not notify Platinum Home Care that they did not object to such calls, as required under Regulation 21(4) of the PECR. In particular, the ICO found that Platinum Home Care was unable to provide any evidence of subscribers notifying them that they did not object to receiving such calls, and failed to undertake proper due diligence checks on the data before use.
Outcome
Consequently, the ICO issued a fine of Â£100,000, to be paid by 22 February 2022, and issued an enforcement notice where it ordered Platinum Home Care to neither use, nor instigate the use of, a public electronic communications service for the purposes of making unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes where the called line is subscribed to the TPS and has not informed that they do not object to receiving calls.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO'), published, on 25 October 2021, its monetary penalty notice, as issued on the same date, in which it imposed a fine of Â£45,000 to Unite the Union, for violations of Regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, 2003 ('PECR'), following the receipt of 27 complaints about unsolicited marketing calls.
Background to the case
In particular, the ICO received complaints from subscribers registered with the Telephone Preference Service ('TPS') register which were made regarding Unite in relation to life insurance marketing calls. In response, the ICO sent an initial investigation letter to Unite and requested for evidence of consent to receive marketing calls, to which Unite responded that it had not made unsolicited marketing calls but updated members on services and benefits available to them under their union membership. Although the ICO found that individuals were told how to opt-out, it added that they were not provided with the option to opt-in to specific means of communication in relation to specific types of services or benefits as aforementioned, especially that which was provided by third parties.
Findings of the ICO
Consequently, the ICO found that UniteÂ had contravened Regulation 21 of the PECR. More specifically, between 11 March 2019 and 11 March 2020, the ICO determined that UniteÂ had used a public telecommunications service for the purposes of making 57,665 unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers where the relevant telephone number was in the TPS register, contrary to Regulation 21(1)(b) of the PECR. In addition, the ICO found that the consent relied upon by UniteÂ was insufficient as it provided broad information to data subjects, rather than the specific detail required under Regulation 21 of the PECR.
In finding the contravention to be serious in nature, the ICO highlighted the multiple breaches of Regulation 21 of the PECR spanning a 12-month period and resulting in 27 complaints and 57,665 unsolicited direct marketing calls.
Despite the ICO considering that Unite had not deliberately set out to contravene the PECR, the notice states that Unite was negligent and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.
In terms of mitigating factors, the ICO noted the remedial action taken by Unite as soon as the contravention was highlighted and that changes were made to its data processor screening process to ensure future compliance.
The ICO decided that Unite has access to sufficient financial resources to pay the proposed penalty without causing undue financial hardship and that this is not affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Outcomes
Finally, the penalty of Â£45,000 must be paid by 25 November 2021 at the latest. Receipt of full payment by 24 November 2021 will reduce the penalty by 20% to Â£36,000. Any notice of appeal should be received within 28 days of the date of the notice.

'''The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 11 July 2022, a report, titled 'Behind the Screens - Maintaining Government Transparency and Data Security in the Age of Messaging Apps', which calls for a government review into risks and areas for improvement around the use of private correspondence channels by the Government. In particular, the report details the ICO's investigation into the use of channels, including private emails, WhatsApp, and other messaging apps, by Ministers and officials at the Department of Health and Social Care during the pandemic. More specifically, the investigation determined that there had been real risks to transparency and accountability, a lack of appropriate organisational or technical controls to ensure effective security and risk management of private correspondence channels, and that the rapid increase in the use of such services had potential to lead to important information on the Government's response to the pandemic being lost or insecurely handled.
Accordingly, the ICO issued the DHSC with a practice recommendation which orders the DHSC to improve its management of freedom of information requests and address any inconsistencies. Simultaneously, the ICO issued the DHSC with a reprimand for violations of Articles 5(1)(e), 5(1)(f), 25, and 32 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation ('UK GDPR'), which requires the DHSC to, among other things,Â improve its processes and procedures around the handling of personal information through private correspondence channels and ensure the security of such information, and recommendations on how to achieve the same.
More widely, the ICO called for the Government to set up a separate review into the use of such channels and how the benefits of new technologies can be realised, whilst ensuring data protection and transparency requirements are met.

'''The Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') announced, on 15 December 2021, that the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California had made its decision in Case No. 2:21-cv-09693 as issued on 15 December 2021 in which it fined OpenX Technologies, Inc. $7.5 million for violations of Â§Â§5(a)(1), 5(m)(1)(A), 13(b), 16(a)(1), and 19 of the Federal Trade Commission Act ('FTC Act'), Â§Â§15-45(a)(1), 45(m)(1)(A), 53(b), 56(a)(1), and 57(b) of the United States Code, and Â§Â§1303(c) and 1306(d) of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ('COPPA'), and theÂ Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule of 1999 ('COPPA Rule'), following the FTC's allegations that OpenX Technologies collected personal information from children under 13 years old without parental consent.
Background to the Decision
In particular, the FTC stated that the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the FTC, filed a complaint against OpenX Technologies after the FTC's allegations that OpenX Technologies secretly collected location data of children under 13 years without parental consent. Against this backdrop, the FTC stated that it launched an investigation and found that OpenX Technologies reviewed hundreds of applications directed at children with terms that identified the intended audience to be children, among others. Furthermore, the FTC stated that it found that the applications and their data were not flagged as children directed and hence participated in the OpenX Technologies advertisement exchange.
To this end, the FTC stated that, since OpenX Technologies knew that the applications on its advertisement exchange were child directed and that it was collecting personal information from children under the age of 13, this was in violation of the COPPA Rule and that OpenX Technologies further violated the FTC Act by falsely claiming that it did not collect geolocation data from users who opted out of such data collection practices. Thus, the FTC proceeded to notify the California Attorney General who filed the case against OpenX Technologies for the violations.
Findings of the Court
The FTC stated that the Court found that OpenX Technologies violated itsÂ COPPA obligations underÂ Â§Â§1303(c) and 1306(d)Â by failing to provide notice to parents of their information practices, as well as failing to obtain parental consent before collecting and processing childrens' personal data. Furthermore, the FTC stated that the Court also found OpenX Technologies in violation ofÂ Â§Â§5(a)(1), 5(m)(1)(A), 13(b), 16(a)(1), and 19 the FTC Act by misrepresenting its collection, use, and disclosure of covered information.
Outcome
As such, the FTC stated that the Court ordered that OpenX Technologies:
Furthermore, the Court stated that OpenX Technologies waived its right to appeal the decision.

Outcome
As such, the OCC assessed a penalty of $60 million against USAA FSB which was taken as a credit to FinCEN's penalty of $80 million bringing the total penalty assessed to $140 million to be paid to the United States Treasury.Â

'''The Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') announced, on 25 May 2022, that it had filed a complaint against Twitter, Inc., imposing a fine of $150 million for violations of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 ('the FTC Act') and of a 2011 orderÂ previously issued by the FTC, for deceptively using account security data for targeted advertising.
Background to the case
In particular, the FTC, in the complaint filed against Twitter, alleged thatÂ from 2014 to 2019Â more than 140 million Twitter users provided their phone numbers or email addresses after the company told them this information would help secure their accounts, as well as for enabling two-factor authentication, and that Twitter failed to mention that those personal data would also be used for targeted advertising.

Findings of the FTC
As such, the FTC found that the defendant's deceptive use of user email addresses and phone numbers violated the FTC Act and the 2011 FTC order, which stemmed from FTC allegations that the company deceived consumers and put their privacy at risk by failing to safeguard their personal information, resulting in two data breaches. Specifically, the FTC stated that the previous order prohibited Twitter from misrepresenting the extent to which the company maintains and protects the security, privacy, confidentiality, or integrity of any nonpublic consumer information. Lastly, the FTC added that Twitter's conduct also violated the EU-USÂ Privacy Shield and Swiss-USÂ Privacy Shield agreements, which required participating companies to follow certain privacy principles in order to legally transfer data from EU countries and Switzerland.

'''The Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') announced, on 15 June 2021, that it had settled charges against First American Financial Corporation for disclosure controls and procedures violations related to a cybersecurity vulnerability that exposed sensitive customer information in violation ofÂ Rule 13a-15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In particular, the SEC order finds that First American failed to maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that all available relevant information concerning a vulnerability in its documents sharing application was analysed for disclosure in the company's reports with the SEC. Furthermore, the SEC noted that, subsequently, a cybersecurity journalist notified First America of the said vulnerability which included over 800 million title and escrow document images dating back to 2003. Moreover, the documents included images containing sensitive personal data such as social security numbers and financial information. In addition, after a prior reportÂ from First American's information security personnel outlining the vunerabilities was not provided to senior executives, an inaccurate form was then submitted to the SEC in violation of Rule13a-15(a). As such, First American agreed to a cease-and-desist order as well as pay a civil penalty of $487,616.

'''The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') announced, on 20 September 2022, its decision in File No. 3-21112, as issued on the same day, in which it imposed a fine of $35 million to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLCÂ ('MSSB'), for violations of Rule 30(a) and 30(b) of the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information ('Regulation S-P'), following failures, over a five-year period, to protect the personal identifying information ('PII')Â of approximately 15 million customers.
Background to the decision
In particular, the SEC stated that, as far back as 2015, MSSB failed to properly dispose of devices containing its customers'Â PII, by hiring a moving and storage company with no experience or expertise in data destruction services to decommission thousands of hard drives and servers containing the PII of millions of its customers. More specifically, the SEC's investigation found that the moving company sold to a third party thousands of MSSB devices, including servers and hard drives, some of which contained customer PII, and which were eventually resold on an internet auction site without removal of such customer PII.
Findings of the SEC
Therefore, theÂ SEC stated that it found thatÂ MSSB violated Rule 30(a) of Regulation S-P which requires that covered entities adopt written policies and procedures that address administrative, technical, and physical safeguards reasonably designed for the protection of customer records and information, as well as Rule 30(b) of Regulation S-P which establishes that covered entities that maintain or possess consumer report information for a business purpose take reasonable measures to protect against unauthorised access to, or use of, the information in connection with its disposal.
Outcomes
As such, the SEC stated that MSSBÂ was in violation of the abovementioned provisions, and accordinglyÂ imposed a fine of $35 million, to pay within 30 days of the entry of this order,Â and ordered them to cease and desist from committing future violations.

('VFA') had agreed to pay $1 million to settle charges in relation toÂ its failures inÂ cybersecurity policies and procedures, following a breachÂ that compromised the personally identifiable information ('PII') of over 5,600 customers ('the Order').Â In particular, SECÂ found that VFA had failed to adopt written policies and procedures reasonably designed to protect customer records and information, in violation of the Safeguards Rule, under Â§248.30(a) of Title 17Â of the Code of Federal Regulations, as well as failed to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention programme, in violation of the Identity Theft Red Flags Rule, under Â§248.201 of Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations ('the Red Flags Rule').

'''The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') published, on 20 May 2022, its decision in Administrative Proceeding No. 3-20866, as issued on the same day, in which it imposed, among other things, a fine of $7 Million on Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC for the violations of Â§17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1940 and Rule 17a-8 under the same Act, following Wells Fargo Advisors'Â failure to timely file certain suspicious activity reports ('SARs') between April 2017 and October 2021 concerning Anti-Money Laundering ('AML').
Background to the decision
In particular, the SEC stated that Wells Fargo Clearing ServicesÂ is dually registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer and an investment adviser, and conducts business and operates under the trade name 'Wells Fargo Advisors' along with Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLCÂ which is also a dually-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
Thus, the SEC stated that in September 2019, as part of a routine, annual sales practice examination of Wells Fargo Advisors, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA') requested information from Wells Fargo AdvisorsÂ about wire transfers over $5,000 to or from high risk or moderate risk countries that appeared to meet the AML transaction monitoring system's requirements, failing, however,Â to trigger the monitoring system's expectedÂ AML alerts.
In addition, the SEC stated that FINRA identified thatÂ the monitoring system had failed to cross-reference between International Organization for Standardization ('ISO') and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency when monitoring wire transfers to or from high risk or moderate risk countries and the same was raised with Wells Fargo Advisors, who tried to fix the problem.
Moreover, the SEC highlighted that, in October 2019, the Financial Crimes Investigations group analysed wire transfers to and from the accounts in which the transactions occurred as part of its AML and Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 ('BSA') compliance obligations to determine whether Wells Fargo Advisors were required to file any SARs related to any of the missed alerts.
Findings of the SEC
As a result of the Financial Crimes Investigations group's analysis, the SEC highlighted that, of the 1,708 wire transfers, Wells Fargo Advisors filed at least 25 late SARs on a rolling basis between October 2019 and February 2020, including one continuing activity SAR and on average, the late SARs were filed 157 days late, and at least seven of the late SARs were filed more than 200 days late.
Thus, the SEC found that Wells Fargo Advisors failed to timely file at least 25 SARs related to AML activity as required by the BSA, and willfully violated Â§17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8 thereunder.
Outcomes
In conclusion, the SEC highlighted that Wells Fargo Advisors' made an offer to it and,Â in light of Wells Fargo Advisors' remedial actions including cooperation with the SEC, sharing results of its internal investigations, and engaging in remedial measures concerning the AML monitoring system, the SEC agreed to the offer.
As such, the SEC ordered, as agreed, that Wells Fargo Advisors, among other things:
